But the word <span class="unicod_txt">adhvara</span> itself has come to denote sacrifice; such a development is impossible for the word. The word <span class="unicod_txt">adhvan</span> means the path, so <span class="unicod_txt">adhvara</span> must signify the voyager or one having the form of the path. The sacrifice was the path that led to the abode of the gods; at the same time, the sacrifice was well-known everywhere as the pilgrim in the abode of the gods. This meaning is right. The word <span class="unicod_txt">adhvara</span> like the word <span class="unicod_txt">adhvan</span> derives from the root <span class="unicod_txt">adḥ</span>; as proof, we find that both the words <span class="unicod_txt">adhva</span> and <span class="unicod_txt">adhvara</span> were used in the sense of sky.</p>

<p class="B-TIT_SUB">The Spiritual Significance. The Universal Sacrifice</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The universal life is like an immense sacrifice.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">God himself is the lord of the sacrifice. God is Shiva, and Nature is Uma. Though she carries the image of Shiva in her heart, still she misses his visible form; she yearns for his tangible body. This yearning is the deep significance of the universal life.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">But by what means can her intention be fulfilled? By which appointed path can Nature attain the Supreme? How can she recover her own true form and that of the Supreme? Her eyes are tied with the bandage of ignorance and her feet are bound with a thousand chains of matter; as if the physical Nature has imprisoned the infinite existence within the finite and herself become the prisoner, no longer able to find the lost key of the self-made prison; as if the inert vibrations of the life-energy in matter have overpowered the free and unlimited Consciousness-Force and made her dumb, self-oblivious and unconscious; as if the infinite Bliss wandering about in the disguise of an inferior consciousness subject to trivial happiness and sorrow, has forgotten its real nature and unable to remember sinks lower and lower in the bottomless mire of suffering; as if the truth has been drowned under the uncertain waves of falsehood. The supramental principle beyond intellect is the foundation of the infinite Truth. The action of the Supermind is either forbidden in the earth-consciousness or very rare like the momentary glimmer of the lightning from behind the veil. The timid, lame and dull mind is again and again looking for it and by its titanic efforts may even catch a glimpse of it but the authentic, infinite and luminous form of the integral Truth escapes its grasp. The knowledge as well as the action of mind are afflicted with the same strife, indigence and failure. Instead of the smiling and effortless divine dance of the Truth-action, there is the shackled attempt of the will-power of the inferior Nature struggling in agony with the inextricable bonds of truth and falsehood, virtue and vice, poison and nectar, action, inaction and wrong action. The free, unhesitating, desireless, triumphant, blissful and passionate divine power of action, intoxicated with the wine of oneness remains as yet unrealised. Its natural and easy universal movements are impossible for the will-power of the inferior Nature. Can the terrestrial Nature, ensnared in the noose of the finite and untrue ever hope to obtain that limitless Existence, that boundless Consciousness-Force, and that immeasurable Bliss-Consciousness, and if so, by what means?</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The sacrifice is the means. The sacrifice implies surrender, and self-immolation. What you are, what you have, what you become in future by your own effort or by the divine grace, what you can earn or save in the course of your action, pour all like clarified butter, into the fire of divine energy, as offering to the all-Blissful. By giving a tiny whole you will receive the infinite whole. The Yoga is implicit in the sacrifice. The infinity, the immortality and the divine felicity are legitimate results of the practice of yoga. To follow this path is the means of Nature&#39;s salvation.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The Universal Nature knows the secret. So with this immense hope, night and day, year in and year out, age after age, sleepless and restless, she performs the sacrifice. All her actions, all her endeavours are part of this cosmic ritual. She immolates everything she produces. She knows that the divine Player who is present in all, tastes the delight without reserve and accepts all effort and askesis as sacrifice. He is the one who is ever slowly leading the cosmic sacrifice on the ordained path towards the ordained goals by detours and zigzags, through rise and fall, across knowledge, ignorance and death. His assurance has made her fearless, unwavering and indiscriminate. Moved by the unceasing and ubiquitous divine impulsion, she consciously throws all that she can lay hands on, creation and killing, production and destruction, knowledge and ignorance, happiness and suffering, the ripe and the unripe, the beautiful and the ugly, the pure and the impure, into that huge eternal conflagration of sacrifice. The subtle arid material objects constitute the clarified butter used in the sacrifice, the Jiva, the being, is the bound animal. The Nature is constantly immolating the Jiva, fastened to the slaying-post with the triple bond of mind, life and body. The bond of mind is ignorance; the bond of life is suffering, desire and conflict; the bond of body is death.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">Nature is shown the path of her salvation; by what means can the Jiva in fetters be delivered? By means of sacrifice, self-surrender and self-immolation. Instead of being under the domination of Nature and being offered by her, the Jiva has to rise, become the sacrificer and offer all that it possesses. This indeed is the profound secret of the universe that the Purusha is not only the god of the sacrifice but the object sacrificed as well. The Purusha has surrendered into the hands of Prakriti his own mind, life and body as offering, as principal means of performing the sacrifice. There is this hidden motive behind his self-surrender that one day, becoming conscious, he will take the Prakriti by the hand, make her his consort and companion in the sacrifice and himself perform the ritual. Man has been created to fulfil this secret longing of the Purusha who wants to play the Lila in a human body. Selfhood, immortality, the multiple infinite bliss, unlimited knowledge, boundless force and immeasurable love must be enjoyed in a human body, in a human consciousness. All these forms of delight exist within the Purusha himself and as the Eternal he enjoys them eternally. But creating man, he is actively engaged in relishing the opposite taste of oneness in the multiplicity, the infinite in the finite, the inward in the outward, the supra-sensible in the senses and the immortal existence in the terrestrial life. Seated at the same time above our mind, beyond our intellect in the hidden Supramental principle of the Truth and in the secret plane of consciousness behind the heart within us, in the cavern of the heart, in the concealed ocean of submerged consciousness where heart, mind, life, body and intellect are only little ripples, the Purusha experiences the delightful taste of the blind effort and search of the Prakriti and her endeavour to establish unity by the shock of duality. Above, he enjoys in knowledge; below, he enjoys in ignorance; he carries on these two actions simultaneously. But if he is for ever immersed in this condition, then the deep intention, his supreme purpose cannot be fulfilled. That is why the day of awakening is fixed for each human being. The inner godhead will one day give up this mechanical, merit-less, lower self-immolation and begin in knowledge, by chanting his own mantra, the performance of the sacrifice. To perform the sacrifice consciously and with the right mantra is the ‘Karma’, the work, mentioned in the Veda. It has a double objective; a completeness in the universal plurality, what is known in the Veda as the universal godhead and the universal manhood, and the realisation of immortality in the one self-being of the supreme Divine. The gods mentioned in the Veda under the names Indra, Agni, Varuna are not the inferior small godheads of later days disdained by the common people; they are different forms of the Divine, powerful and luminous. And this immortality is not the puerile heaven described in the Puranas, but the svar, the world of Divine Truth desired by the Vedic Rishis, the establishment of the Infinite Existence; the immortality mentioned in the Veda is the infinite Being and Consciousness of the Existence-Consciousness-Bliss.</p>

<p class="B-TIT_SUB_SUB">[Notes]</p>
<p class="P5_0_150_20_j">6. “The good (happiness) which thou wilt create for the giver, that is that truth of thee, O Agni.” In other words, the essence of this truth, which is the nature of Agni, is the freedom from evil, the state of perfect good and happiness which the Ritam carries in itself and which is sure to be created in the mortal when he offers the sacrifice by the action of Agni as the divine priest. Bhadrammeans anything good, auspicious, happy and by itself need not carry any deep significance. But we find it in the Veda used, like ṛtam, in a special sense. It is described in one of the hymns (V.82) as the opposite of the evil dream (duḥṣvapnyam), the false consciousness of that which is not the Ritam, and of duritam, false going, which means all evil and suffering. Bhadramis therefore equivalent to suvitam, right going, which means all good and felicity belonging to the state of the Truth, the Ritam.</p>
<p class="P5_0_150_20_j">7. There seems to be stated the condition of the effective sacrifice. It is the continual resort day by day, in the night and in the light, of the thought in the human being with submission, adoration, self-surrender, to the divine Will and Wisdom represented by Agni. Night and Day, Naktoṣāsā, are also symbolical, like all the other gods in the Veda, and the sense seems to be that in all states of consciousness, whether illumined or obscure, there must be a constant submission and reference of all activities to the divine control.</p>

<p class="P5_0_150_20_j">1. I adore Agni the god, the Purohit of the sacrifice, the Ritwik, the Hota, most delight-placing.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">I seek with adoration the God-Will, divine priest of the sacrifice placed in front, sacrificer in the seasons, offerer of the oblation, who most ordains the ecstasy.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">Agni (<span class="unicod_norm">अग्</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">अज्</span>) is the brilliant, the strong, the preeminent, he who moves, leads, drives, acts. He is the Flame, at once Heat and Light, Force and self-possessing Consciousness in the Force, Will with perfect revealing and intuitive knowledge in the will and its acts, — the Seer-Will of the one &amp; infinite Divine Conscious-Existence at work in the universe.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The Rishi, seeker and finder of knowledge, adores and seeks this divine Seer-Will as the priest of the inner sacrifice by which man seeks the godhead. He is the priest in the three chief functions of that divine priesthood. The divine Seer-Will is the Purohit, that power which is placed in front of our consciousness to act for the human being; replacing the fallible human will this divine force as soon as it is kindled conducts the sacrifice; he leads it in its journey through the stages by which the sacrificer rises to the supramental divine consciousness; he is its vanguard and front-fighter in the battle of the divine with the undivine and the march of man to his goal, <span class="unicod_norm">पुरएता</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">प्रणेता</span>. The Seer-Will is the Ritwik, he sacrifices in the order, the right seasons, the right periods, the twelve months, the hundred years of the sacrificial session: he knows the time, place, order by which the Swadha, the self-arranging self-movement of the divine Nature in man that is developing itself, progresses till it turns itself into the Swaha, the luminous self-force of the fulfilled divine Nature of the gods. This order of the sacrificial seasons is called <span class="unicod_norm">ऋतु</span> and represents the progressive movement of development of the hidden truth of things in man. The Seer-Will is also the Hota, the power that brings the divine powers into the physical consciousness of man by his flaming force in the revealed Word, manifests &amp; forms them there and offers to them the whole activity of the being as a sacrifice of the lower human to the higher divine. The result of this progressive action is the divine delight or ecstasy, the Ananda of the infinite &amp; divine Consciousness, brought into man, there established, held, expanding till it possesses the whole being and occupies all the energies. The Seer-Will is the godhead in us which is most powerful thus to establish, hold, order the action of the Delight in us. This delight is represented as the wealth of the divine existence, by the words <span class="unicod_norm">रयिः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">राधः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">राः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">रत्न</span>, each of which has a different connotation. <span class="unicod_norm">रयिः</span> is simply the accumulation of the riches, the mass of the felicity; <span class="unicod_norm">राधः</span> its riches as affecting the mental, emotional heart-consciousness, its vital and sensible abundance; <span class="unicod_norm">राः</span> is the bliss, the higher joy of these riches, more than mental in its touch on man; <span class="unicod_norm">रत्न</span> is its pure ecstasy of the Ananda. This last aspect, as it is the culmination of the Vedic <span class="unicod_norm">वेदस्</span> , the finding, conscious possession of the Divine, is rightly put here in front in the first rik of the Veda. The Seer-Will is the first means, the Ananda of the divine riches the ultimate aim and last achievement of the Vedic Yoga.</p>
<p class="B-TIT">10. <a target="_self" name="_11" href="#11_" title='&#1056;.&#1042;. 1.1.– Notebook // CWSA.– Vol. 16.– Hymns to the Mystic Fire.– Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, 2013, pp. 545-550. (Part 3, &#8470; 9).'>1913 – early 1914<sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">I will cite first a passage in the first hymn of the first Mandala, the invocation to Agni with which the Rig Veda opens. Agni the god of the sacred flame, ruler of the sacrifice, is described there as the “shining guardian of the Truth increasing in his own home”, <span class="unicod_txt">gopām ṛtasya dīdivim</span>. If we wish to render this verse ritualistically and take Agni as nothing but the physical fire we must interpret rita otherwise, “king of the sacrifices, the shining guardian of the rite”, and if he increases in his own home, it must be in the house of sacrifice or on his own place on the altar. Or if “<span class="unicod_txt">ṛta</span>” is the cosmic Law Agni is the god of fire who is the guardian of the Law — in what sense? — and who is manifested in the sacrificial flame on the altar. Now, if we take the rik by itself, there is no means by which we can decide among these and other possible interpretations. But in the first place the idea of the guardian of the <span class="unicod_txt">ṛta</span> is a common thought of the Vedic Rishis and it occurs in passages where <span class="unicod_txt">ṛta</span> cannot well mean the sacrifice; even the phrase <span class="unicod_txt">gopām ṛtasya</span> occurs elsewhere with this clear significance. The gods generally are said to be born in the Rita, <span class="unicod_txt">ṛtejaḥ</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">ṛtajātaḥ</span>; they are increasing the <span class="unicod_txt">ṛta</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">ṛtāvridh</span>, protecting the <span class="unicod_txt">ṛta</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">ṛtapā</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">ṛtasya gopā</span>, touching the <span class="unicod_txt">ṛta</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">ṛtaspriś</span>, sending down streams of the <span class="unicod_txt">ṛta</span>, knowing the <span class="unicod_txt">ṛta</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">ṛtam id cikiddhi</span>, rita-conscious, <span class="unicod_txt">ṛtacid</span>. It is evident even at a first glance, and we shall be able to establish it conclusively enough, that <span class="unicod_txt">ṛta</span> must mean in these phrases some kind of truth and not the ritual of the sacrifice. Moreover this rik is preceded by three others in which there is repeated mention of the ideas of truth and thought and knowledge. Therefore in the absence of convincing reasons to the contrary we are justified in supposing that Agni is described as the shining guardian of the Truth and it must then immediately occur to us that if he is spoken of here in a psychological function and the Truth is a psychological not a physical conception, then he is described as its “shining” guardian because his light is necessary to that guardianship. The light of the god must therefore be an image for a psychological and not a physical illumination. Equally, the own home of such a deity increasing in the exercise of such a function should be rather a psychological region than the house of ritual sacrifice or a place on a sacrificial altar.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">Let us examine the three Riks more minutely. The fifth verse runs: “Agni, the priest of the oblation (or, of the summoning), the seer-will (or he whose work, whose sacrifice or whose power-of-works is a seer’s), the true, who has most richly-varied (inspired) knowledge, may he come, a god with the gods.” In this verse we have two words of doubtful meaning, <span class="unicod_txt">śravas</span> and <span class="unicod_txt">kratu</span>. Sayana wherever he can, renders <span class="unicod_txt">śravas</span> food, elsewhere fame, or where neither of these will do, <span class="unicod_txt">śravas</span> (also <span class="unicod_txt">śruṣti</span>) is for him wealth or rarely hymn. But there is the word <span class="unicod_txt">satya</span>, true! That he forces to mean “giving true or right results of the sacrifice”, evidently a meaning which the text itself does not suggest and read into the word from the commentator’s mind. Again there is the phrase <span class="unicod_norm">कविक्रतुः</span> and we cannot fit this into the ritualistic interpretation unless we destroy the Vedic significance of the word Kavi. Well then, we have two words <span class="unicod_txt">satya</span> and <span class="unicod_txt">kavikratu</span> which suggest a profound psychological character for the god Agni, the shining guardian of the Truth. It does not matter how we take <span class="unicod_txt">kratu</span>. Kavi is the seer, one who has vision of the revealed Truth and receives the inspired word, the <span class="unicod_txt">draṣṭā</span> of the Vedic mantra with the inspired mind of knowledge. If <span class="unicod_txt">kratu</span> is sacrifice — Sayana often prefers “work” — then Agni is the priest whose sacrifice is that of the seer, therefore the sacrifice over which he presides is that over which the divine knowledge presides; if work, then he is the god of the inspired workings; if power of workings, then the god whose power for works is guided by divine knowledge. I suggest that <span class="unicod_txt">kratu</span> which Sayana sometimes interprets [as] knowledge and which has for one of its senses “mind”, is in a psychological sense the mental power that presides over all action, that is to say the will or the volitional mind. The two words <span class="unicod_txt">kavikratuḥ satyaḥ</span>, coming together in this intimate way, cannot be disconnected; the phrase must mean therefore that Agni is guided in his will or his works by the seer’s vision of the Truth because he is himself true in his being, free from the cosmic falsehood. What then of <span class="unicod_txt">citraśravastamaḥ</span>? Has it no connection at all with the two preceding words or does it mean that because Agni is true in being and has the seer-will, therefore he gives man all sorts of food or all sorts of wealth? I suggest that <span class="unicod_txt">śravas</span> means hearing or that which is heard (this is the root of its other sense fame) and is used by the mystics for the inspired knowledge which is contained in the Vedic mantra or else simply the inspirations that come from the divine Truth of which Agni is the seer. We have then a clear connection and interdependence of sense in the three epithets of Agni, he is the Truth in his being, therefore his will or works are those of the seer of the Truth and he receives all the varied inspirations of the knowledge that comes from the Truth; for that reason he is the <span class="unicod_txt">hotā</span> in the sacrifice which the soul of man offers to the Lords of the Truth. We see at once in these three illuminative epithets all that is meant by the description of Agni as the shining guardian of the Truth.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The next verse runs, “O Agni, the good which thou wilt create for the giver, thine verily is that truth, O Angiras.” This is interpreted ritualistically, “The good that thou wilt do to the giver, that (good) is <i>thine</i>, (this statement is) true (and not false).” But it is hardly possible on any rational law of poetic composition that <span class="unicod_txt">satyam</span> here should have no relation to <span class="unicod_txt">satya</span> immediately preceding it in the last verse. At any rate, the phrase <span class="unicod_txt">tat satyam</span> is used elsewhere in the Veda to mean “that truth” and is applied to the hidden sun or imprisoned light which the Angirases find as the result of their sacrifice &amp; seeking in the cave of the Panis. Here too in connection with the same phrase <span class="unicod_txt">tat satyam</span>, Agni is described as the Angiras. The coincidence can hardly be fortuitous. Now the Angiras of the Veda, we shall find, is precisely the seer-puissance or seer-will, <span class="unicod_txt">kavikratuḥ</span>. So the good which Agni, the Angiras or seer-will, is to create for the human soul, giver of the sacrifice, is that divine Truth now withheld from man, the hidden light, the lost Sun which the powers of the seer-will find for man. We see in another hymn that Bhaga, a Sun God, creates this good or <span class="unicod_txt">bhadram</span> for man by getting rid of the evil dream to which the darkness or falsehood of existence belongs. We shall find too that in the Vedic idea the divine bliss or immortality of beatitude was held to be a result of the winning of the supramental Truth and this is evidently the idea which the verse indicates. It is indeed the central conception of the Vedic doctrine.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The next verse introduces and is connected in syntax with the rik which speaks of Agni as the guardian of the Truth; the two have to be taken together. “To thee, O Agni, we come day by day, in the night and the light, bringing with (or, by) the thought the obeisance; to thee ruling over the sacrifices, shining etc.” This in the ritualistic sense must mean that the priests offer sacrifice daily both during the day and during the night by means of the hymn or the work (Sayana interprets <span class="unicod_txt">dhī</span> sometimes in one sense, sometimes in the other according to his pleasure, but sometimes admits the significance “thought” or “understanding”), bringing, that is to say, doing obeisance or perhaps bringing the food or portion to the <a target="_self" name="_12" href="#12_" title='Sayana interprets “namas” sometimes as food, a sense which he gives to a host of Vedic words, even to brahma, dyumna etc. I do not see why he should avoid it here, where it goes so well with &#2349;&#2352;&#2306;&#2340;&#2307;.'>god<sup>12</sup></a>. But if Agni is the god of an inner Flame, then we must interpret the verse differently. We see that the obeisance is brought, carried (<span class="unicod_txt">bharantaḥ</span>, Latin <span class="unicod_txt">ferentes</span>, Gr. <span class="greek_txt">φέροντες</span>) by the thought; therefore, the obeisance must be an inner bowing down or submission to an inner flame. <span class="unicod_txt">Namas</span>, the obeisance, implies also obedience; the verb is used in the Veda in the sense of subduing. Now Agni kavikratuh is the luminous force or will-power of the Divine Existence, <span class="unicod_txt">ekam sat</span>; the force is the flame, the light of the flame is the knowledge; therefore he is the shining guardian of the Truth, for his unified power and knowledge protect all the workings of the divine Truth in the universe. The sacrifice offered by Man is a sacrifice offered for the conquest and conscious possession of this Truth at present concealed from him by ignorance and darkness. Therefore he is the ruler of the sacrifice; therefore the seekers come to him from day to day bringing to him submission in their thought so that the divine Will may govern their mentality and their action and lead it to the Truth. Day and night are, we shall see, symbols of the dark and illumined states of the human mind; the former is our ordinary consciousness, the latter that on which there comes the dawn, the light and power from the supramental Truth. Moreover this Agni increases in his own home. We shall see hereafter whether the own home of Agni is not the plane of the supramental Truth itself on which the divine powers dwell and from which they descend to the aid of the seeker. We must also understand the weal or “good state of being” [in] the closing verse, “Be easy of approach to us as a father to his child; cleave to us for our happy being”, as the state of bliss, the good, bhadram, which comes by the possession of the Truth. The Rishi is obviously not asking physical fire to allow him to approach and embrace it as a son with his father or pleading to fire to cleave to him for his welfare; the fulfilment of such a prayer would be slightly inconvenient and hardly lead to welfare. It is to the godhead, the Divine, that he prays, not the sacrificial flame on the altar, and what can be meant by the cleaving of a godhead to man, — not, be it noted, merely its succour or nearness — if Agni does not represent some divine power which must embrace the human being as a father his child and whose constant presence leads, not to the possession of herds and slaves and gold, but to a spiritually perfect state, <span class="unicod_txt">svastaye</span>? It is because the words of the Veda are not given their proper force, because we shirk their precise and evident meaning, preferring to think that the Rishis wrote loosely, clumsily and foolishly rather than to admit that they had other and profounder &amp; subtler thoughts than ours — it is for this reason that we miss constantly the true sense of the Veda.</p>

<p class="B-TIT_SUB">Notes.</p>
<p class="P5_0_150_20_j">1. <span class="unicod_norm">ईळे</span>. To praise, in the ritualistic sense; but <span class="unicod_norm">ईड्</span> is a secondary root of <span class="unicod_norm">ई</span> and means to seek, go towards, attain, desire, adore, pray to, ask for (cf <span class="unicod_norm">मातरमन्नमैट्ट</span>). The former senses have been lost and only “to desire”, “pray” or “ask for” are left in later Sanskrit; but the other senses must have existed, as the idea of desiring, asking is never a primary sense of any root, but derived figuratively from the physical sense “to go, seek, approach”. We may therefore render <span class="unicod_norm">ईळे</span> either “seek”, “desire”, “adore” or “pray to”.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">पुरोहितं</span>. Sayana, “Purohit”, or else “placed in the front of the sacrifice as the Ahavaniya fire”. The Purohita of the Veda is the representative power in the sacrifice who stands in front of the consciousness and the action and conducts it. This is always the force of the “placing in front” which is so common an idea in the hymns. Normally this place belongs to Agni who leads the sacrifice.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">देवं</span>. Sy. <span class="unicod_norm">दानादिगुणयुक्तं</span>. Sayana’s dealing with the word <span class="unicod_norm">देव</span> is peculiar; sometimes he renders it simply “god”, sometimes he gives it some root value, <span class="unicod_norm">दान</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">देवन</span>, sometimes he makes it mean the priest. There is not a single passage in the Veda where the ordinary sense “god”, “divine being” does not give a clear and sufficient &amp; the best sense. No doubt, the Vedic poets never left out of sight its root meaning; the gods are the Shining Ones, the Lords of Light as are the Dasyus the Dark or Black Ones, the sons of Darkness.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्विजं</span>. “He who sacrifices at the right season” is the outward or ritualistic sense; but <span class="unicod_norm">ऋतु</span> in the Veda, as we shall see, is the order of the truth, its arranged law, time, circumstance. Agni is the representative priest who sacrifices according to the law, order, season of the Ritam.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">होतारं</span>. Sy. “because he utters the Mantra” and he quotes <span class="unicod_norm">अहं होता</span> <span class="unicod_norm">स्तौमि</span>; but he renders it sometimes <span class="unicod_norm">आह्वाता</span>, sometimes <span class="unicod_norm">होमनिष्पादकः</span>, sometimes gives us the choice. Undoubtedly <span class="unicod_norm">होता</span> is the priest of the oblation, who gives the offering, <span class="unicod_norm">हु</span> to offer, and not <span class="unicod_norm">हू</span> to call. The hymn was an attendant circumstance of the offering, therefore the invocation or praise might also fall to the part of the <span class="unicod_norm">होता</span>; but in the system of the Rigveda the proper name for the reciter of the Mantra is <span class="unicod_norm">ब्रह्मा</span>. Agni is the Hotri, Brihaspati the Brahma.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">रत्न</span>. Sy. <span class="unicod_norm">यागफलरूपाणां रत्नानामतिशयेन धारयितारं पोषयितारं वा</span>. <span class="unicod_norm">धा</span> to hold and <span class="unicod_norm">धा</span> to nourish (cf <span class="unicod_norm">धात्री</span> nurse). But in other passages he takes <span class="unicod_norm">रत्न</span> = <span class="unicod_norm">रमणीयं धनं</span> which shows that he took it to mean literally “that which is delightful” and made it = wealth, as he makes <span class="unicod_norm">द्युम्न</span> = “that which is shining” and renders it “wealth”. We need not follow him. <span class="unicod_norm">रत्नं</span> means “delight” or Ananda (cf <span class="unicod_norm">रम्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">रतिः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">रण्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">रण्व</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">राध्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">रंज्</span> etc) just as <span class="unicod_norm">द्युम्नं</span> means “light”. <span class="unicod_norm">धा</span> is to hold or else to place.</p>
<p class="B-TIT_SUB_SUB">Ritualistic sense</p>

This <span class="unicod_norm">स</span> seems to have been either frequentative in force, “he constantly or habitually bears”, or intensive, “he entirely bears”, or desiderative, “he wills or intends to bear”. From the latter sense we have the use of <span class="unicod_norm">स</span> for the future, cf S. <span class="unicod_norm">नी</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">नेष्यामि</span>, Greek <span class="unicod_txt">luo</span>, I loose, <span class="unicod_txt">luso</span>, I shall loose, and English, I <i>will</i> go, where the desiderative will = wish, intend, has acquired the sense of a simple future.</p>

It is connected in sense with <span class="unicod_norm">या</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">यत्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">यस्</span> . We have in the Veda <span class="unicod_norm">रयि</span>, wealth or felicity, often described as expansive, pervading, breaking down obstacles on the way.

<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">रयिं</span>. There are two words <span class="unicod_norm">रयि</span>, from <span class="unicod_norm">रि</span> to go and from <span class="unicod_norm">रि</span> to attain, enjoy. The latter means “enjoyment” or the things enjoyed, “felicity, prosperity, riches”. The former sense is found in the Upanishad where <span class="unicod_norm">रयि</span> movement or matter is opposed to <span class="unicod_norm">प्राण</span> life.</p>
<p class="B-TIT_SUB_SUB">Ritualistic</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">By Agni one attains a wealth daily increasing, famous and most full of men.</p>

<p class="P5_0_150_20_j">4. <span class="unicod_norm">अध्वरं</span>. Sy. <span class="unicod_norm">हिंसारहितं</span> because it is not destroyed by the Rakshasas, from <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span> privative + <span class="unicod_norm">ध्वर</span> (<span class="unicod_norm">ध्वृ</span> to hurt). But <span class="unicod_norm">अध्वर</span> is used by itself to mean sacrifice and it is quite impossible that the word “unhurt” used by itself can have come to mean sacrifice. It must express some essential quality of the sacrifice or it could not thus have been singled out. It is a notable fact that <span class="unicod_norm">अध्वर</span> is continually used for the sacrifice when there is a question of the sacrifice travelling or moving on the path towards the gods, as here. I therefore take <span class="unicod_norm">अध्वर</span> from an original Rt <span class="unicod_norm">अध्</span> to move, &amp; connect it with <span class="unicod_norm">अध्वन्</span> path; it means the moving or travelling sacrifice, the sacrifice regarded as a pilgrimage of the soul or its gifts towards the gods.</p>
<p class="B-TIT_SUB_SUB">Ritualistic</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">O Agni, the unhurt sacrifice that thou encompassest on all sides, that goes to the gods.</p>
<p class="B-TIT_SUB_SUB">Psychological</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">O God-Will, whatsoever sacrifice on the path thou encompassest with thy being on every side, that indeed arrives to the gods.</p>
<p class="P5_0_150_20_j">5. <span class="unicod_norm">कविक्रतुः</span>. Sayana takes <span class="unicod_norm">कवि</span> here = <span class="unicod_norm">क्रांत</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">क्रतुः</span> = either knowledge or work. It means then “the priest whose work or whose knowledge moves”. But there is absolutely no reason to take <span class="unicod_norm">कवि</span> in any other than its natural &amp; invariable sense. <span class="unicod_norm">कवि</span> is the seer, the one who has the divine or supramental knowledge. <span class="unicod_norm">क्रतु</span> from <span class="unicod_norm">कृ</span> or rather old root <span class="unicod_norm">क्र</span> to divide, to do, make, shape, work. From the sense “divide” comes that of the discerning mind, Sy’s <span class="unicod_norm">प्रज्ञान</span>; cf Grk. <span class="unicod_txt">krites</span>, judge etc; and this is the sense of <span class="unicod_txt">karuttu</span> in Tamil which means mind. But from the sense “to do”, <span class="unicod_norm">क्रतु</span> means (1) work, (2) power of work, strength, cf Grk. <span class="unicod_txt">kratos</span>, strength, (3) will or working force of the mind. For this last sense, cf Isha Upanishad <span class="unicod_norm">क्रतो कृतं स्मर</span> where the collocation <span class="unicod_norm">क्रतो कृतं</span> shows that that power of the mind is meant which conducts or dictates the work or action. Agni is the divine Seer-Will that works with the perfect supramental knowledge.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">सत्यः</span>. Sayana explains “true in its fruits”; but the collocation of “seer will” and <span class="unicod_norm">श्रवः</span> inspired knowledge indicates rather the sense “true in his being” &amp; therefore true in knowledge <span class="unicod_norm">श्रवः</span> and in will <span class="unicod_norm">क्रतुः</span>. <span class="unicod_norm">श्रवः</span> is the supramental knowledge called the Truth, <span class="unicod_norm">ऋतं</span>, the vijnana of the Upanishads; <span class="unicod_norm">कविक्रतुः</span> means having the will that is full of that knowledge, the vijnanamaya will, the divine Ājnana; <span class="unicod_norm">सत्यः</span> means “vijnanamaya in his substance”.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">चित्रश्रवस्तमः</span>. Sy. having most varied kinds of fame, — an insipid &amp; meaningless epithet for a god. <span class="unicod_norm">श्रवः</span> is used like <span class="unicod_norm">श्रुति</span> to indicate the inspired hymn; it must therefore be capable of meaning inspired knowledge. There are two kinds of supramental knowledge, <span class="unicod_norm">दृष्टि</span> &amp; <span class="unicod_norm">श्रुति</span>, sight &amp; hearing, revelation and inspiration, but <span class="unicod_norm">श्रवः</span> is usually used to indicate the knowledge gained by the supramental faculties.</p>

<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">अग्निम् ।</span> The primitive root <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span>, to be, when combined with certain consonants <span class="unicod_norm">क्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">ग्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">ज्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">र्</span> , contracted a sense of existence in the superlative, <span class="unicod_norm">क्</span> giving more the sense of height &amp; intensity, <span class="unicod_norm">ग्</span> of strength, solidity or quantity, <span class="unicod_norm">ज्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">र्</span> , of rapidity, vigour, activity, command. All strong action or quality could be denoted by <span class="unicod_norm">अग्</span> , as in <span class="unicod_norm">अग्रः</span>, Gr. <span class="greek_txt">ἄϰρος</span>, topmost, first, foremost; <span class="greek_txt">ἄγω</span>, ago, I lead, act; <span class="greek_txt">ἀγαθός</span>, good, brave; <span class="greek_txt">ἄγαν</span>, excessive; names like Agis, Agamemnon, Agamedes (cf Sanscrit <span class="unicod_norm">अजः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">अजमीढः</span>); <span class="greek_txt">ἀγλαός</span>, brilliant; etc. In Sanscrit the root <span class="unicod_norm">अर्</span> is much preferred to the guttural combination. There can be no doubt, however, that <span class="unicod_norm">अग्</span> in <span class="unicod_norm">अग्निः</span> meant strong, brilliant, forceful. Nasalised, we have it in <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्गति</span> fire (also a conveyance, cf <span class="greek_txt">ἄγω</span> &amp; S. <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्ग्</span>), <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्गारः</span> a live coal, <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्ग्</span> to stir, move; and in <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्गिरः</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">अगस्ति</span>,— the former term often applied to Agni. There was another signification, to cling, embrace, love, which we find in the Greek <span class="greek_txt">ἀγάπη</span>, love, <span class="greek_txt">ἀγανός</span>, tender, gentle, charming, which seems to have been another meaning of <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्गिरः</span>, loving, and appears in the mode of address <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्ग</span>, in <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्कः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्गम्</span> etc, &amp; in <span class="unicod_norm">अनङ्ग</span> the god of love. Agni is the bright and strong, the bright god of fire, the strong, burning god of Tapas, heat and force.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">ईळे <span class="unicod_norm">।</span> The root is <span class="unicod_norm">इल्</span> or <span class="unicod_norm">ईल्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">ळ्</span> being a modification which now survives only in the Southern Aryan tongues, Marathi, Tamil etc. <span class="unicod_norm">इल्</span> is itself a secondary root from <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span> to go, move, go after, wish for, desire, go to, reach, embrace, possess, control (cf <span class="unicod_norm">ईह्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">इच्छ्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">ईश्</span>). The liquid increases the closeness of contact, steadiness of action, or soft intensity of feeling. <span class="unicod_norm">ईल्</span> is to love, woo, desire, adore, embrace, press upon physically or mentally urge, crowd. The meaning, praise, is of later development from the sense of wooing or adoration. In words like <span class="unicod_norm">इला</span>, the earth, <span class="unicod_norm">इल्</span> has the original sense of motion. I adore or desire, or I praise will equally fit the first line, but in view of the second, where the coincident root <span class="unicod_norm">ईड्</span> means obviously desirable or adorable, not praiseworthy, the more primitive meaning must be preferred.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_txt">पुरोहितं</span> <span class="unicod_norm">।</span> Not Purohit, but placed in front. Unless we take Yajna in the sense of sacrifice, there is no need to take <span class="unicod_norm">पुरोहितम्</span> in any but its original and primitive sense. Agni may be described as the Purohita or representative of the gods in the sacrifice, he is in no sense a sacrificer at the ceremony, in no sense either Purohit or Ritwik. He is the eater of the sacrifice not its priest. Even if Yajna is taken to mean sacrifice, Agni cannot rightly be called its priest, and <span class="unicod_norm">पुरोहितम्</span> will still have to mean standing in front, but with the idea of the Gods supplied and the genitive <span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञस्य</span> understood of general relation without any idea of possession, “who stands forth for the gods at the sacrifice”. But the language of the Vedas is always precise and sufficient and no such omission of a word need be supplied.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञस्य ।</span> <span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञ</span> is acknowledged to be a name for Vishnu, for the Supreme Lord, and the Supreme is not a sacrifice. We must find some other meaning for <span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञ</span> in the etymology of the word. We find the kindred <span class="unicod_norm">यमः</span> which means he who controls, governs, as in <span class="unicod_norm">नियन्ता</span> and other members of the <span class="unicod_norm">य</span> family of roots. The sense of force put forth to reach, obtain or control is a common significance in this group. “Restraint” is a sense of the word <span class="unicod_norm">यः</span>, “obtaining” of <span class="unicod_norm">याः</span>; “effort, control, mastery” is found in <span class="unicod_norm">यत्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">यतः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">यतिः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">यत्न</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">यन्ता</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">यन्त्र्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">यम्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">यमः</span> (<span class="unicod_norm">नियमः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">संयमः</span>), <span class="unicod_norm">यामः</span>; <span class="unicod_norm">ययी</span> is a name of Shiva; <span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञः</span> itself is a name of Agni, the master of <span class="unicod_norm">तपः</span> or force in action and exertion; <span class="unicod_norm">यशः</span> is fame, glory, beauty, wealth, — in Bengali, success, attainment, probably a survival of its original sense; in <span class="unicod_norm">यविष्ठ</span> youngest, from a lost <span class="unicod_norm">यवः</span>, not lost to the Veda, <span class="unicod_norm">युवन्</span> youth etc, &amp; in <span class="unicod_norm">यव</span> barley, <span class="unicod_norm">यवसः</span> grass, the root sense is “strong, flourishing, vigorous”; <span class="unicod_norm">यस्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">यासः</span> (<span class="unicod_norm">आयासः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">प्रयासः</span>) bring us back to the idea of effort and labour. These significations arise [as] developments from the sense of “going”, (combined with effort or an original impetus), with its common, almost invariable development of going after, seeking, striving, desiring, (<span class="unicod_norm">या</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">याच्</span>), also reaching, meeting, mixing, acquiring, joining, embracing, enjoying (<span class="unicod_norm">यु</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">युज्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">योगः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">यामी</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">योषा</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">युध्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">योनि</span>) and the sense of reaching to, joining to or handing, from which we have the idea of giving, <span class="unicod_norm">यच्छ्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">यज्</span> in the sense of sacrifice, cf <span class="unicod_norm">याजयति</span>. The sense of strong one, master, controller, lord is established for <span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञः</span> by the application to Vishnu and Agni, continued at a time when the etymological justification had been lost; the sense of sacrifice is established by the universal later use. But it is also capable of the same senses as <span class="unicod_norm">योगः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">यत्न</span> or the lost <span class="unicod_norm">यत्</span> from which we have <span class="unicod_norm">यतिः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">यतः</span> etc; it could mean effort, action, tapasya, Yoga; this sense is the basis of the idea attached to the word <span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञः</span> in the Gita and of the meaning of adhiyajna there as the One in whom all action, tapasya and Yoga rest and to whom they are consciously or unconsciously devoted. The modern form of the Gita is there trying to assimilate an older form in which <span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञः</span> had its natural meaning, — Yoga, action, tapasya.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">देवम् ।</span> The root <span class="unicod_norm">दिव्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">दीव्</span> commonly means either “to shine” or “to play”. It is the former sense that gives us <span class="unicod_norm">देवः</span>, the shining ones, referring to the luminous tejomaya bodies proper to the inhabitants of the Swarloka where tejah is the primary element in all forms. <span class="unicod_norm">देव</span> by detrition of the <span class="unicod_norm">व</span> gives Latin <span class="unicod_txt">deus</span> and Greek <span class="greek_txt">θεός</span>; from the long root <span class="unicod_norm">दीव्</span> we have <span class="unicod_txt">divus</span> and <span class="unicod_txt">diva</span>.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्विजम् ।</span> For a reason already alleged, this word need not &amp; should not be taken in the modern sense. The modern derivation <span class="unicod_norm">ऋतु</span> &amp; <span class="unicod_norm">इज्</span> , sacrificing in season, is a forced etymology, imposed after the word had contracted its modern meaning. The Ritwik was not a sacrificer in season any more than the Purohit, Hota, Brahma or Adhwaryu. The word meant originally “seer or knower of the truth, the right, the law, the Ritam”, and in this sense it was applied to the priest whose duty it was to see that everything was done according to the fixed rule and rationale of the sacrifice. But originally it had no such narrow significance. It meant “the seer of the ritam” and as applied to Agni it had the same sense as “jatavedah”, he to whom the Veda or direct vision of truth has appeared, — for <i>jata</i> in this word has nothing to do with birth. Even if we take the etymology to be <span class="unicod_norm">ऋतु</span> + <span class="unicod_norm">इज्</span> , this sense is perfectly possible, <span class="unicod_norm">ऋतु</span> will then be used in its original sense of established truth, ascertained thought, fixed law (from which the sense of “proper time, season” arose) and <span class="unicod_norm">इज्</span> in the sense “obtain, acquire, know”, common to the groups of roots which have the sense of motion towards. I suggest, however, that the combination is <span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्</span> truth, and <span class="unicod_norm">विज्</span> to see perfectly or decisively. The combination is not contrary to the old laws of sandhi, eg <span class="unicod_norm">वर्त्</span> + <span class="unicod_norm">म</span> = <span class="unicod_norm">वर्त्म</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">पत्</span> + <span class="unicod_norm">नी</span> = <span class="unicod_norm">पत्नी</span> etc. The liquid and nasal consonants did not originally call for the modification of the preceding hard consonant in composition.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The root <span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्</span> contracts the sense of truth from the original force of <span class="unicod_norm">ऋ</span> to go, move, go to, to reach, find, know, think, fix. We find in Sanscrit <span class="unicod_norm">ऋजु</span>, fixed, straight, honest; <span class="unicod_norm">ऋत</span>, right, proper, true; <span class="unicod_norm">ऋतम्</span> , rule, law, truth, right; <span class="unicod_norm">ऋतु</span>, a fixed time, season, period, a fixed order or rule; <span class="unicod_norm">ऋभु</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">ऋभ्व</span>, wise, skilful; <span class="unicod_norm">ऋषि</span>, thinker, knower, sage; <span class="unicod_norm">ऋषु</span>, wise. In Latin we have <span class="unicod_txt">reor</span>, I think, judge; <span class="unicod_txt">ratus</span>, thought, fixed, settled, valid; <span class="unicod_txt">ratio</span>, rule, method, reason, view, principle; also calculation, account etc; <span class="unicod_txt">rectus</span>, straight, right; <span class="unicod_txt">regula</span>, a rule.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The root <span class="unicod_norm">विज्</span> usually means an intense state of existence, as in Latin <span class="unicod_txt">vigor</span>, strength, vigour; <span class="unicod_txt">vigere</span>, to flourish; cf <span class="unicod_txt">vireo</span>, to flourish, be green, <span class="unicod_txt">vir</span>, a hero, S. <span class="unicod_norm">वीरः</span> from a brother root; S. <span class="unicod_norm">विज्</span> to be excited (<span class="unicod_norm">उद्वेगः</span>), <span class="unicod_norm">वेगः</span> speed, intensity; but it has other meanings, eg to discriminate, decide, judge. The primary <span class="unicod_norm">वि</span> means to appear, burst out, be divulged, to split open, separate, and, transitively, to see, know, discriminate, separate, divulge, expose, etc. A great regiment of words in Tamil &amp; a few in Latin bear evidence to this sense, especially the Tamil for eye <span class="tamil_txt">விழி </span>and the root <span class="tamil_txt">விள்</span> with its numerous derivatives; a number of words meaning open, public, sale, auction, publication etc; Latin <span class="unicod_txt">vile</span>, common, cheap; <span class="unicod_txt">villa</span>, open place, country place, county seat; <span class="unicod_txt">vendo</span>, I sell; <span class="unicod_txt">venalis</span>, to be sold; but especially <span class="unicod_txt">video</span>, I see. In Sanscrit we have <span class="unicod_norm">विद्</span> to know; <span class="unicod_norm">विज्</span> to separate, discriminate; <span class="unicod_norm">विच्</span> in the same sense; <span class="unicod_norm">वि</span> itself always implying in some form division or separation; <span class="unicod_norm">विना</span>, except, without, from the same sense; <span class="unicod_norm">विप्</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">विप्र</span> a wise man, seer; <span class="unicod_norm">आविर्</span> manifest; <span class="unicod_norm">विल्</span> to divide, break, &amp; in the causal form to send forth, throw out (originally, to divulge, manifest); <span class="unicod_norm">बिलम्</span> (<span class="unicod_norm">विलम्</span>) a hole, fissure; <span class="unicod_norm">विश्</span> to enter in, penetrate; <span class="unicod_norm">विष्</span> to separate, disjoin; <span class="unicod_norm">वी</span> to be born or produced, appear; shine, produce; <span class="unicod_norm">वीपा</span> lightning; <span class="unicod_norm">वियत्</span> the open sky; and others. <span class="unicod_norm">विज्</span> may therefore mean either to see, or to separate and discriminate.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">होतारम् ।</span> The word <span class="unicod_norm">होता</span> again means a sacrificial priest, and it is curious, if these senses are to be taken, that three different words meaning different kinds of sacrificial priests, should be applied to Agni in the course of a short line composed of eight words and not one with any definite appropriateness either to Agni himself or to the context. We must seek a more appropriate meaning.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The root <span class="unicod_norm">हु</span> like all <span class="unicod_norm">ह्</span> roots must have had originally the sense of “to use force violently or aggressively, to come into aggressive contact, to throw, throw out, strike, kill”. This sense we find in <span class="unicod_norm">हा</span> to throw away, abandon; <span class="unicod_norm">हत</span> from <span class="unicod_norm">ह</span>, slain, killed; <span class="unicod_norm">हन्</span> to strike, injure, kill; <span class="unicod_norm">हिंस्</span> ; <span class="unicod_norm">हिंसा</span> injury, slaughter; <span class="unicod_norm">हेतिः</span> a weapon; <span class="unicod_norm">हंसः</span> a swan (one who flies flapping the wings); <span class="unicod_norm">हठः</span> violence, force, rapine; <span class="unicod_norm">हद्</span> to discharge (excrement), (cf Bengali <span class="unicod_txt">হাগা</span>); <span class="unicod_norm">हनुः</span> weapon, disease, death, (Greek <span class="greek_txt">θάνατος</span>, death, <span class="greek_txt">θνητός</span>, mortal); <span class="unicod_norm">हथः</span> a blow, killing, death; <span class="unicod_norm">हय्</span> to be weary; <span class="unicod_norm">हयः</span> horse (galloper); <span class="unicod_norm">हृ</span> to seize, ravish; <span class="unicod_norm">हरिः</span> anything strong, swift, brilliant, bright coloured (cf <span class="unicod_norm">हरिणः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">हरित्</span>); <span class="unicod_norm">हल्</span> to plough, move strongly (we find traces of the idea of moving strongly in the vernaculars, cf <span class="unicod_norm">हिल्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">हिल्लोल</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">ह्वल्</span>); <span class="unicod_norm">हस्</span> to ridicule, originally to insult, slight, humiliate; cf <span class="unicod_norm">हिण्ड्</span> to disregard, slight; <span class="unicod_norm">हि</span> to cast, shoot; <span class="unicod_norm">हिक्क्</span> to hurt, injure, kill; <span class="unicod_norm">हुण्ड</span> a tiger; <span class="unicod_norm">हुल्</span> to injure, kill; <span class="unicod_norm">हुडः</span> a ram (butter, fighter); <span class="unicod_norm">हेड्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">हेल्</span> to slight; <span class="unicod_norm">हेठ्</span> to vex, hurt; <span class="unicod_norm">होडृ</span> a robber; <span class="unicod_norm">होड्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">हौड्</span> to slight; <span class="unicod_norm">ह्नु</span> to rob, take away; <span class="unicod_norm">ह्रस्</span> to waste, diminish; <span class="unicod_norm">ह्रेद्</span> &amp; <span class="unicod_norm">ह्रेष्</span> to sound loudly, roar, neigh; <span class="unicod_norm">ह्री</span> to be put to shame. So insistent are these senses of this violent root that it is impossible to believe that <span class="unicod_norm">हु</span> alone, unlike its secondary roots, <span class="unicod_norm">हुण्ड्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">हुड्</span> &amp; <span class="unicod_norm">हुल्</span> , should not have shared in them. As a matter of fact we find that the sense of sacrifice comes from the idea of throwing; to throw in the fire, hence to sacrifice. We have also the sense of calling, <span class="unicod_norm">हवः</span> a cry, call; <span class="unicod_norm">ह्वे</span> to call, where the idea is of the violent throwing out of the sound from the throat (cf <span class="unicod_norm">ह्राद्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">ह्रेष्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">हेष्</span> etc) and finally <span class="unicod_norm">आहवः</span>, battle. It is in this word <span class="unicod_norm">आहवः</span> that we get the key to the ancient sense of <span class="unicod_norm">हु</span> to slay, strike, fight. If it had this sense in the time of the Veda we may take <span class="unicod_norm">होता</span> as slayer, fighter, <span class="unicod_norm">हव</span> as meaning both battle &amp; cry, call, <span class="unicod_norm">होत्रं</span> as war, battle. On this supposition Agni hota is the slayer, the warrior, the smiter of the foe.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">रत्नधातमम् ।</span> Again we have a word we cannot take in its modern sense. <span class="unicod_norm">रत्न</span> in the sense of jewel comes from the idea of glittering, coruscating which is an original sense of the root <span class="unicod_norm">र</span> &amp; its derivatives. This root <span class="unicod_norm">र</span> &amp; its brother root <span class="unicod_norm">रा</span>, meant originally to vibrate, to be intense in movement, contact, feeling, so to coruscate, glitter, break up, play, rush, shout, rejoice, feel ecstasy. We have <span class="unicod_norm">रः</span> in the sense of fire, heat, love, desire, speed; <span class="unicod_norm">रा</span> gold; <span class="unicod_norm">रं</span> brightness, lustre; <span class="unicod_norm">रंह्</span> to go swiftly; <span class="unicod_norm">रंहतिः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">रंहस्</span> speed, impetuosity; <span class="unicod_norm">रकः</span> the sunstone, crystal or a hard shower; <span class="unicod_norm">रक्</span> to taste, (take delight of); <span class="unicod_norm">रक्त</span> painted, brilliantly coloured, impassioned, playful; <span class="unicod_norm">रघु</span> swift; <span class="unicod_norm">रंगः</span> colour, amusement, passion; <span class="unicod_norm">रजतं</span> silver; <span class="unicod_norm">रजस्</span> originally strength, swiftness, passion, force; the dancing of broken dust, etc, cf <span class="unicod_norm">रद्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">रन्ध्रं</span> ; <span class="unicod_norm">रंज्</span> to colour, be enamoured, delighted; <span class="unicod_norm">रट्</span> to shout, call out; <span class="unicod_norm">रणः</span> (literally a charge), war, combat, ringing sound; <span class="unicod_norm">रथः</span> a chariot, a hero or fighter (<span class="unicod_norm">महारथः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">अतिरथः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">अधिरथः</span> where the sense is evidently a fighter and has nothing to do with chariot); ecstasy, delight; <span class="unicod_norm">रभ्</span> to clasp, embrace; start off, begin; <span class="unicod_norm">रभस्</span> impetuosity, vehemence, in Bengali, violent delight or ecstasy; cf S. <span class="unicod_norm">राभस्यं</span> y delight, violence; <span class="unicod_norm">रम्</span> to play, rejoice, delight; <span class="unicod_norm">रंभ्</span> to bellow; <span class="unicod_norm">रय्</span> to stream, go; <span class="unicod_norm">रश्मिः</span> ray, beam; <span class="unicod_norm">रस्</span> to cry out, scream; taste, relish; <span class="unicod_norm">रसः</span> delight, taste, liquid, (from “to flow”). Cf also <span class="unicod_norm">रागः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">राधा</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">राम</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">रामा</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">रावः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">रवः</span> etc. The root <span class="unicod_norm">रत्</span> from which <span class="unicod_norm">रत्न</span> may come (unless we compound <span class="unicod_norm">र</span> + <span class="unicod_norm">त्न</span>, but this is contrary to the evidence of <span class="unicod_norm">यत्नः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">पत्नी</span> etc) is not found except in <span class="unicod_norm">रात्रिः</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">रातिः</span> where it is significant that <span class="unicod_norm">राति</span> means a friend, a gift, ready or generous, which may all have come from the sense of delight, play etc; <span class="unicod_norm">रात्रिः</span> &amp; <span class="unicod_norm">रजनी</span> may also mean the time of enjoyment. We have too <span class="unicod_norm">रतिः</span>, delight, which is usually derived from <span class="unicod_norm">रम्</span> . In any case the evidence of the other roots gives as the most probable meanings of a root <span class="unicod_norm">रत्</span> , delight, light or vehemence of feeling, motion or action. In this passage the two first alone will enter naturally into the sense of the verse. Agni is addressed either as the giver of light, ritwij and jatavedas — for physically Agni is the disposer of light only through Surya — or as the giver of delight, because tapas is the basis of all ananda. But this metaphorical sense of “light” is a doubtful use and for other reasons as well, foreign to the etymological considerations, I prefer the sense of “delight” to the other and more obvious significance.</p>

There is another possible signification. I suggest that the root <span class="unicod_norm">इह्</span> was used in the ancient tongue to signify “strength, force”. That this sense of strength was inherent in the <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span> roots is evident from the Sanscrit <span class="unicod_norm">इन्द्रः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">इन्</span> to invigorate, force, compel, <span class="unicod_norm">इनः</span> able, mighty, lord, master, <span class="unicod_norm">इभ्य</span> wealthy, opulent, rich, a king, <span class="unicod_norm">इषः</span> full of sap or strength, <span class="unicod_norm">ईश्</span> to rule, master, Greek <span class="greek_txt">ῖφι</span>, <span class="greek_txt">ἴφθιμος</span>. <span class="unicod_norm">एह</span> would be an adverb formed from <span class="unicod_norm">इह्</span> by gunation to <span class="unicod_norm">एह्</span> and the addition of <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span> either adverbially or as an accusative termination and would mean strongly, forcibly, with strength.</p>

<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">अध्वरम् ।</span> Not sacrifice, but an adjective from <span class="unicod_norm">अध्</span> a secondary root of <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span> to be. The sounds <span class="unicod_norm">ध</span> &amp; <span class="unicod_norm">व</span> appear to have given an idea of weight, solidity and dullness, with which the ideas of dense matter or downward motion were easily associated. We have <span class="unicod_norm">अव</span> of descent. We have <span class="unicod_norm">अधः</span>, a formation from <span class="unicod_norm">अध्</span> by the addition of the nominal <span class="unicod_norm">अस्</span> used in the neuter adverbially; we have <span class="unicod_norm">अधरः</span> &amp; <span class="unicod_norm">अधमः</span>, lower &amp; lowest from some lost adjective <span class="unicod_norm">अधः</span> low; we have <span class="unicod_norm">अध्वन्</span> a path, originally perhaps a way of descent, a path down, but this is not certain as we have <span class="unicod_norm">अट्</span> to wander and there are other proofs of a sense of motion in <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span> roots. Given a word <span class="unicod_norm">अध्व</span> descent, as we have <span class="unicod_norm">इत्वन्</span> &amp; <span class="unicod_norm">इत्वरः</span> formed from a lost <span class="unicod_norm">इत्व</span>, so we shall have <span class="unicod_norm">अध्वन्</span> &amp; <span class="unicod_norm">अध्वरः</span> formed from this lost <span class="unicod_norm">अध्व</span>, &amp; meaning descending or descended, lower. <span class="unicod_norm">अध्व</span> must also have been capable of the sense substantial or material being, like <span class="unicod_norm">अन्नम्</span> a kindred root, but <span class="unicod_norm">अध्वर</span> in the Veda evidently refers to more than the annamaya existence. It embraces the whole aparardha or lower hemisphere of existence believed in by the Vaidic thinkers. It is the opposite of <span class="unicod_norm">उत्तरः</span>.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">गच्छति</span> <span class="unicod_norm">।</span> In the original sense of moving, not of going towards a particular direction. Cf <span class="unicod_norm">गा</span> the moving earth, <span class="unicod_norm">जगती</span> etc.</p>

<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">O Agni, the Lord below whom thou encompassest with thy being on every side, is the same that moveth in the gods.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">कविक्रतुः ।</span> <span class="unicod_norm">क्रतुः</span> again has nothing to do with a sacrifice. It meant activity, mastery, strength, doing, action, or the adjectives of these significations. It also meant like <span class="unicod_norm">केतुः</span> word of the same root family Will or Force. Cf Greek <span class="greek_txt">ϰράτος</span>, <span class="greek_txt">ϰρατερός</span>, <span class="greek_txt">ϰραταιός</span>, <span class="greek_txt">ϰρείσσων</span> (<span class="unicod_norm">क्रतीयान्</span>), <span class="greek_txt">ϰράτιστος</span>. The Vedic <span class="unicod_norm">शतक्रतुः</span> does not mean Indra of a hundred sacrifices, but Indra of destroying strength. It is notable in how many cases the obsession of the idea of sacrifice has perverted the original sense of words. The perversion is beyond doubt. The only question is whether it was done before or after the composition of the Vedic hymns.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">कविः</span>. The root <span class="unicod_norm">कु</span> from the initial sense of curve, hollow, took the derivative idea of containing, holding, knowing, or forming, constructing, writing, drawing etc (cf the similar association of ideas in the <span class="unicod_norm">म्</span> roots). We have, therefore, the double idea of a sage and a poet or artist, familiar throughout Sanscrit literature. But for <span class="unicod_norm">कविः</span> in this passage we must suppose the sense not of the knower, but of knowledge. The addition of the nominal <span class="unicod_norm">इः</span> had always this double utility of indicating the agent or the state or action. <span class="unicod_norm">कविः</span> means the comprehensive knowledge, the art or science of a subject. Cf <span class="unicod_norm">कोविदः</span>.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">चित्रश्रवः ।</span> <span class="unicod_norm">श्रवः</span> from <span class="unicod_norm">श्रु</span> to hear may indicate either fame, Gr. <span class="greek_txt">ϰλύω</span>, <span class="greek_txt">ϰλέος</span> oc or knowledge gained by <span class="unicod_norm">श्रुति</span>. We must take it in the latter significance when it is applied in a poem where all the words and circumstances are designed to show the principal qualities and activities of the god Agni, the jataveda. Sruti is one of the three processes of ideal knowledge by which Veda is conveyed.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">देवेभिः ।</span> The third case used not to indicate the instrument, but the accompaniment.</p>
<p class="B-TIT_SUB_SUB">Translation.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">Agni, the warrior, the strong in knowledge, the true, the rich in revelation, has come a god with the gods.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">अङ्ग्</span> . From <span class="unicod_norm">अग्</span> to cling, embrace, love, nasalised. Originally “dear”, answering to the Greek <span class="greek_txt">φίλος</span> or <span class="greek_txt">πέπων</span>, it became a familiar style of address, “<span class="greek_txt">ὦ φίλε</span>”, “<span class="greek_txt">ὦ πέπον</span>”, and lost its original shade.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">दाशुषे ।</span> This is a word of considerable importance. In the sacrificial interpretation of the Vedas it must mean a giver, sacrificer; in the religious interpretation it means an enemy, one who hurts or kills or desires to hurt or kill. Both significances are possible etymologically, both give a good sense in this verse. The ceremonial interpretation will run, “That thou wilt do good to the sacrificer, this is that truth of thee, O Agni Angiras”; the religious, “O beloved, that thou, O strong Agni, meanest to do good to him that would hurt thee, this is that truth in thee, O lord of might &amp; love.” <i>Satyam</i> refers us back to the “satya” in the last shloka and indicates like every other epithet there used the truth to the right nature of things, the ritam, in the vijnana, the ideal or spiritual plane of existence, where hatred ceases and evil ceases, because these are asatyam, perversions and misunderstandings of the play of God in the universe.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">अङ्गिरः ।</span> When applied to Agni, this epithet means etymologically the brilliant or mighty, like <span class="unicod_norm">अग्निः</span> itself, but there is an unmistakable allusion here to the other significance of “loving, tender, attached”, deduced from <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्ग्</span> to love. In <span class="unicod_norm">अनङ्ग</span>, the other notable Sanscrit word denoting this sense of <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्ग्</span> , the <span class="unicod_norm">अन्</span> is obviously intensive or reduplicative, not privative. Cf <span class="unicod_norm">अनर्च</span> from <span class="unicod_norm">अर्च्</span> etc for reduplication; <span class="unicod_norm">दीदिविः</span> etc for its intensive force. When the idea of the true Nirukta was lost, the false idea of “bodiless” was conveyed into this name of Kamadeva and the story of the Kumarasambhava brought in to explain so inapt an epithet.</p>
<p class="B-TIT_SUB_SUB">Translation.</p>

<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">धिया</span> <span class="unicod_norm">।</span> Used throughout the Veda of the Buddhi, the discerning reason. he reference in this line is to the buddhiyoga and yogic atmasamarpanam enjoined afterwards in the Gita.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">नमो</span> <span class="unicod_norm">।</span> Rt <span class="unicod_norm">नम्</span> to bend, submit. <span class="unicod_norm">नमो</span> means submission or obeisance (cf Grk. <span class="greek_txt">νόμος</span>, rule, law, custom, that to which one is subject). But <span class="unicod_norm">भरन्तः</span> from the root <span class="unicod_norm">भृ</span> does not mean here to fill, but is used in the older sense of to bear (cf <span class="unicod_norm">भारः</span>, Greek <span class="greek_txt">φέρω</span>, Lat. <span class="unicod_txt">fero</span>). We may therefore more appropriately take <span class="unicod_norm">नमो</span> in the active sense of that which bends, controls; as in the Greek <span class="greek_txt">νόμος</span>, — law, rule, mastery. The participle here used as a verbal adjective dispenses with the necessity of a finite verb.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">एमसि ।</span> We have seen that the <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span> roots develop the idea of strength; this sense is particularly appropriate to the combination with <span class="unicod_norm">म्</span> which means limit, extreme; cf Latin <span class="unicod_txt">imus</span>, originally extreme, farthest, afterwards lowest. <span class="unicod_norm">एमसि</span> means, on this supposition, thou growest to thy full or extreme strength.</p>

In connection with a <span class="unicod_norm">अध्वराणाम्</span> we must take it in the latter sense, which is, besides, especially appropriate after the <span class="unicod_norm">नमो</span> <span class="unicod_norm">भरन्तः</span> of the last line.</p>

<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">गोप ।</span> Protector, from <span class="unicod_norm">गुप्</span>  to embrace, shelter, protect. There can be no doubt that this is the significance. The introduction of a vocative, however, is out of place in a series of accusatives. I suggest that <span class="unicod_norm">गोप</span> is an old form of the accusative preserved by tradition. That there was such an accusative form appears from the Greek <span class="greek_txt">γύψ</span>, <span class="greek_txt">γύπα</span> etc, where there is no trace of a terminal m. The nominative then would be not <span class="unicod_norm">गोपः</span> but <span class="unicod_norm">गोप्</span> .</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">दीदिविम्</span> <span class="unicod_norm">।</span> A strong reduplicated form from <span class="unicod_norm">दिव्</span> to shine, meaning tejas, force, energy, brilliance, splendour. There is a doubt here as to the relation of <span class="unicod_norm">अमृतस्य</span>. If it is with <span class="unicod_norm">गोप</span>, it must be taken to mean nectar or immortality and Agni is the protector of the amrita in the body or of the immortality of the body; if with <span class="unicod_norm">दीदिविम्</span> , it must mean the Immortal, God, and Agni is a splendid energy of the Immortal. The general sense of the verse will be the same, since <span class="unicod_norm">अमृतस्य दीदिविम्</span> in the latter interpretation explains how Agni has the force to be the protector of all creatures here below.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">दमे ।</span> house, home, territory.

<p class="B-TIT_SUB">First Mandala. First Hymn</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">Madhuchchhanda Vaisvamitra’s Hymn to Agni written in the Gayatri metre in which the first verse runs in the devabhasha</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">“Agnim īle puro hitam Yajnasya devam ritvijam, hotaram ratnadhatamam”</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">and in English,</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">“Agni I adore, who stands before the Lord, the god who seeth Truth, the warrior, strong disposer of delight.”</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">So the Rigveda begins with an invocation to Agni, with the adoration of the pure, mighty and brilliant God. “Agni (he who excels and is mighty),” cries the Seer, “him I adore.” Why Agni before all the other gods? Because it is he that stands before Yajna, the Divine Master of things; because he is the god whose burning eyes can gaze straight at Truth, at the satyam, the vijnanam, which is the Seer’s own aim and desire and on which all Veda is based; because he is the warrior who wars down and removes all the crooked attractions of ignorance and limitation (asmajjuhuranam eno) that stand persistently in the way of the Yogin; because as the vehicle of Tapas, the pure divine superconscious energy which flows from the concealed higher hemisphere of existence, (avyaktam, parardha), he more than any develops and arranges Ananda, the divine delight. This is the signification of the verse.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">Who is this Yajna and what is this Agni? Yajna, the Master of the Universe, is the universal living Intelligence who possesses and controls His world; Yajna is God. Agni also is a living intelligence that has gone forth, is srishta, from that Personality to do His work and represent His power; Agni is a god. The material sense sees neither God nor gods, neither Yajna nor Agni; it sees only the elements and the formations of the elements, material appearances and the movements in or of those appearances. It does not see Agni, it sees a fire; it does not see God, it sees the earth green and the sun flaming in heaven and is aware of the wind that blows and the waters that roll. So too it sees the body or appearance of a man, not the man himself; it sees the look or the gesture, but of the thought behind look or gesture it is not aware. Yet the man exists in the body and thought exists in the look or the gesture. So too Agni exists in the fire and God exists in the world. They also live outside of as well as in the fire and outside of as well as in the world.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">How do they live in the fire or in the world? As the man lives in his body and as thought lives in the look or the gesture. The body is not the man in himself and the gesture is not the thought in itself; it is only the man in manifestation or the thought in manifestation. So too the fire is not Agni in himself but Agni in manifestation and the world is not God in Himself but God in manifestation. The man is not manifested only by his body, but also and much more perfectly by his work and action, thought is not manifested only by look and gesture, but also and much more perfectly by action and speech. So too, Agni is not manifested only by fire, but also and much more perfectly by all workings in the world, — subtle as well as gross material, — of the principle of heat and brilliance and force; God is not manifested only by this material world, but also and much more perfectly by all movements and harmonies of the action of consciousness supporting and informing material appearances.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">What then is Yajna in Himself and what is Agni in himself? Yajna is Being, Awareness and Bliss; He is Sat, with Chit and Ananda, because Chit &amp; Ananda are inevitable in Sat. When in His Being, Awareness and Bliss He conceals guna or quality, He is nirguna Sat, impersonal being with Awareness and Bliss either gathered up in Himself &amp; passive, they nivritta, He also nivritta or working as a detached activity in His impersonal existence, they pravritta, He nivritta. Then He should not be called Yajna, because He is then aware of himself as the Watcher and not as the Lord of activity. But when in His being, He manifests guna or quality He is saguna Sat, personal being. Even then He may be nivritta, not related to His active awareness and bliss except as a Watcher of their detached activity; but He may also by His Shakti enter into their activity and possess and inform His universe (pravishya, adhisthita), He pravritta, they pravritta. It is then that He knows Himself as the Lord and is properly called Yajna. Not only is He called Yajna, but all action is called Yajna and Yoga, by which alone the process of any action is possible, is also called Yajna. The material sacrifice of action is only one form of Yajna, which, when man began to grow again material, took first a primary and then a unique importance and for the mass of men stood for all action and all Yajna. But the Lord is the master of all our actions; for Him they are, to Him they are devoted, with or without knowledge (avidhipurvakam) we are always offering our works to their Creator. Every action is therefore an offering to Him and the world is the altar of our lifelong session of sacrifice. In this worldwide karmakanda the mantras of the Veda are the teachers of right action (ritam) and it is therefore that the Veda speaks of Him as Yajna and not by another name.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">This Yajna, who is the Saguna Sat, does not do works Himself, (that is by Sat), but He works in Himself, in Sat, by His power of Chit, — by His Awareness. It is because He becomes aware of things in Himself by some process of Chit that things are created, brought out, that is to say, srishta from His all-containing non-manifest Being into His manifest Self. Power &amp; awareness, Chit and Shakti are one, and though we speak for convenience’ sake of the Power of Chit, &amp; call it Chichchhakti, yet the expression should really be understood not as the Power of Chit, but as Chit that is Power. All awareness is power and all power conceals awareness. When Chit that is Power begins to work, then She manifests Herself as kinetic force, Tapas, and makes it the basis of all activity. For because all power is Chit subjectively, therefore all power is objectively attended with light; but there are different kinds of light, because there are different manifestations of Chit. Seven rays have cast out this apparent world from the Eternal Luminousness which dwells like a Sun of ultimate being beyond its final annihilation, adityavat tamasah parastat, and by these seven rays in their subjectivity the subjective world and by these seven rays in their objectivity the phenomenal world is manifested. Sat, chit, ananda, vijnanam, manas, prana, annam are the sevenfold subjectivity of the Jyotirmaya Brahman. Prakasha, agni, vidyut, jyoti, tejas, dosha and chhaya are His sevenfold objectivity. Agni is the Master of the vehicle of Tapas. What is this vehicle of Tapas of which Agni is the master? It is fiery light. Its Master is known by the name of his kingdom. Strength, heat, brilliance, purity, mastery of knowledge and impartiality are his attributes. He is Yajna manifest as the Master of the light of Tapas, through whom all kinetic energy of consciousness, thought, feeling or action is manifested in this world which Yajna has made out of His own being. It is for this reason that he is said to stand before Yajna. He or vidyut or Surya full of him is the blaze of light in which the Yogins see God with the divine vision. He is the instrument of that universal activity in which Yajna at once reveals and conceals His being.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">Agni is a god — He is of the devas, the shining ones, the Masters of light — the great cosmic gamesters, the lesser lords of the Lila, of which Yajna is Maheswara, the one Almighty Lord. He is free and unbound or binds himself only in play. He is inherently pure and he is not touched nor soiled by the impurities on which he feeds. He enjoys the play of good &amp; evil and leads, raises or forces the evil towards goodness. He burns in order to purify. He destroys in order to save. When the body of the sadhak is burned up with the heat of the tapas, it is Agni that is roaring and devouring and burning up in him the impurity and the obstructions. He is a dreadful, mighty, blissful, merciless and loving God, the kind and fierce helper of all who take refuge in his friendship.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">Knowledge was born to Agni with his birth — therefore he is called jatavedas.</p>

<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">[1] “Agni I adore who stands before the Lord, the god who seeth Truth, the warrior, strong disposer of delight.”</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">So the Rigveda begins with a song to Agni, with the adoration of the pure, mighty and brilliant God. “Agni, he who excels and is mighty,” cries the Seer, “him I adore.” Why Agni before all the other gods? Because it is he that stands before Yajna, the Master of things; because he is the god whose burning eyes can gaze straight at Truth, at the satyam, the vijnanam, that which is the Seer’s aim and desire and the thing on which all Veda is based; because he is the warrior who wars down and removes all the crooked attractions of ignorance and desire, <i>juhuranam enas</i>, which stand in the way of the Yogin, because as the vehicle of Tapas, the pure divine energy which flows from the higher concealed hemisphere of existence, he more than any develops and disposes Ananda, the divine delight.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">In order to look into the words of the inspired writing and comprehend, so far as mere intellectual exposition can help us to comprehend, their profound meaning, we must begin with the Vedanta, the great fundamental body of truth which all Veda assumes; for it is by the passing into oblivion of this fundamental knowledge that we have lost the key to the meaning of the Vedas, and it is only by a return to the knowledge that we can recover it. There are two states of being in consciousness, the divine Brahmi sthiti of blissful unity, from which we descend, and the divided state of the Jivatman into which we have descended. Parabrahman reveals himself first as Yajna, the Supreme Soul and Master of Things, Atman and Iswara; He is utterly one as Atman, He is both One and Many as Iswara, but always without losing His unity, always one without a second, ekam evadwitiyam, because the Many, both in their individuality and totality, are nothing but the One. Nothing is but God; we too are God, each one of us is He, and that which we dwell in is God. The fundamental sayings, So Aham; Tattwamasi, Swetaketo; sarvam khalu idam Brahma, are the sum of all Veda and Vedanta. All is merely the manifestation of Him for the sake of various delight; for Ananda the worlds are, from Ananda they proceeded, by Ananda they abide, to Ananda they return. Anandaddhyeva khalvimani bhutani jayante, anandena jatani jivanti, anandam prayantyabhisanvishantiti. In this manifestation He as the Universal God pervades, governs, surpasses all. He is the master of the play, — <span class="unicod_norm">यजति</span>, He controls, rules and arranges it. This is Yajna. He again as the manifold individual God, ourselves, attaches Himself to every created thing (sarvabhuteshu) and limits not Himself but His manifestation in each adhara, arranging and perpetually developing in each a particular nature or law of life, a swabhava, a dharma. So ’rthan yathatathyato vyadadhacchaswatibhyah samabhyah. When we identify ourselves with the play of this various Nature reflected upon our consciousness and lose sight of our godhead, then we resort too utterly to the principle of Avidya, God’s power of not knowing Himself, we become its servants, we are subject to Apara Maya, we stumble about buffeted by grief and error and all sorts of vikaras and viparita vrittis, we know ourselves as the Jivatman and other than the Paramatman, we make division where there is no division; we turn play into bitter earnest and love and joy into hatred and weeping and gnashing of teeth. Nevertheless, this forgetfulness is allowed in order that our secret souls in the Parardha and Brahman in them may enjoy the viparita ananda, the contrary or perverse delight, of the dualities. When we forget the play of Nature on our consciousness, shut our consciousness to it, refuse to reflect it, then we resort too utterly to the principle of Vidya, God’s power of knowing His essential unity, we become subject to the Maya of Knowledge, we seem to baffle and bring to nought for ourselves the joy of the Lila, and disappear into some principle of Oneness, Prakriti, Asad Brahman, Sad Brahman, Nirvana or Sacchidananda. It is, or seems, an unnecessary movement; for the world remains just as before so long as God chooses that it shall remain and we cannot end it by our precipitation, and for ourselves we always were Brahman, we always will be Brahman and we are not any the more Brahman by our flight into the Absolute. Nevertheless, this withdrawal too is allowed in order that certain select spirits may help the joy of the manifest world from behind the veil by their immanent blessedness. For we have no need of laya and no need of lila, no need of freedom and no need of bondage, but all things are for delight and not from necessity. But when we remember always and continually our oneness with the Supreme, our eternal and indefeasible Godhead, and at the same time allow Nature to reflect its movements on our souls as on a magical canvas according to His eternal purpose, then we have inalienable joy, then we bring heaven upon earth, then we fulfil the highest purpose of existence. We are then free even when we seem to be bound, and even if we are born again, we are janmasiddha and janmashuddha, nityamukta, and wear the temporary limitations of Nature as children allow themselves to be bound in a game with bonds which the Yajna, Master of the Revels looses Himself when we have given Him and ourselves the intended and perfect satisfaction.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">It is in the spirit of this knowledge that the hymns of the Rigveda have been written. The Isha Upanishad is the Upanishad of the Rigveda and it is there that its spiritual foundations are revealed. To make of Avidya a bridge to immortality and of Vidya the means of keeping our grasp on immortality, is the common aim of the Rigvedic Rishis. This is the keynote, this is the one great tone swelling through its thousand undertones. And as our fingers fall on string after string of this mighty and many-stringed harp of God, they return always one cry, the cry of joyous battle, of war between Deva and Daitya, between mortality and immortality, between man’s temporary imperfection and his eternal perfectibility.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">In this holy war the Gods are our chief helpers. There are seven planes of cosmic consciousness on which the soul of man plays with the love and wisdom and power of God. When first the unknowable Parabrahman turns towards knowableness in this partial manifestation, — for utterly That allows itself not to be known, — the Absolute first becomes — to the possibility of knowledge, not to its actuality — the Eternal Being or Paratpara Purusha, paro ’vyaktad avyaktah sanatanah, who beyond the uttermost darkness of the Asat, Sunyam Brahma or eternal nothingness which is the ultimate negation of this manifest existence shines ever with the light unknown of which seven rays are sufficient to illuminate all these universal systems. He is that perceivable but unknowable glory seated for ever beyond the darkness that swallows up the worlds, tamasah parastat. Out of Him the Asad Brahma appears, the general negation, through which this mighty manifestation in the seven universes passes back into the unknowableness of Parabrahman; and out of the Asad, the Sat, the general affirmation which we know as pure Atman, Self of itself, not yet of things, where nothing is yet differentiated and even Chit and Ananda are involved in mere featureless existence. Asad va idam agra asit, tatah sad ajayata. Atman is featureless, unconnected, inactive, alakshanam avyavaharyam akriyam. It must be featureless in order to contain all possible feature; it must be unconnected with the play of the worlds in order that Chit may play upon Sat with perfect freedom and put forth into the worlds without limitation whatever name, form or being the Lord commands Her to put forth; it must be inactive in order that there may be illimitable possibilities for Her action. For Atman is the foundation and continent of our worlds and if Atman had any definite feature or any bondage of connection or any law of activity, the world play which it supports and contains would be limited by that feature, by that connection or by that activity and God in His manifestation would be bound and not free. Therefore it is that as the featureless, free, inactive Sad Atman the Eternal first manifests Himself on this side of the darkness of Asat. Next, in Atman, He appears to His self-knowledge as the Nirgun Brahma, the Being without quality of the Parabrahman, manifesting an impersonal self-existence, an impersonal self-awareness and an impersonal self-delight, Sat, Chit, Ananda. This too is Tat or That, but being unlike Parabrahman Tat in manifestation can be described, defined, cognised, not as anything else but as Atman and as Sacchidanandam. Tat in manifestation can be aware or unaware of the worlds and It can be both aware and unaware, but its cognition is without relation. It has no connection with the worlds in which it cognises and perceives activity merely as the play of a dream on the surface of its imperturbable quiet. On the calm of the Nirgunam God next imposes Himself (adhyaropayati) as the Personality of the Eternal, the Paratpara Purusha manifest in relation to the world. Here first we get relation, quality, activity. At first, the Personality merely contains and informs the activity which plays in it not as unrealised dream, but as realised though not binding actuality and truth, as an infinite active blissfulness of the Chit in the Sacchidananda in place of an infinite passive blissfulness. The indifference of the Impersonal to the play of the Personal does not make the play an unreality or an immense cosmic falsehood with which Brahman amuses Himself or distresses Himself for a season, any more than the featurelessness of the Sad Atman makes feature a lie and an impossibility. On the contrary just as that featurelessness is the necessary condition for features to manifest truly, infinitely, divinely — for Truth, infinity and Deity are one, — so the detachment of the Impersonal is simply the condition for the security of the soul when it plunges into the myriad-billowed ocean of manifest existence. The Impersonal is detachment from guna and it is as detached from guna that God possesses and enjoys guna, otherwise He would be bound by and could not rightly enjoy it. It is because the tranquillity and indifference of the Nirguna is concealed within us that our souls can with impunity play at being bound, at being ignorant and at being sorrowful without being really bound by our bonds or darkened by our ignorance or destroyed by our sorrow. For being omnipotent God within us can always go back to the tranquillity within Him and look upon these things as a dream that falls away from Him the moment He cares to wake. It was a dream, but not a dream, just as when we are aware of sights and sounds without attending to them or remember the past and it is to us dreamlike, swapnamaya. The world has a reality, but the Impersonal does not interest Itself in that reality, not attending to it; it does not properly recognise it except as a thing 
that is and yet is not, the Maya of Shankara. This also is not a lie but truth, not a foolish, blissful dream, but a perfect reality. Because it was avyakta in the Nirguna, it is not therefore false when it becomes vyakta any more than an apple hidden is an apple non-existent. The world is not utter reality because it is thing in manifestation, not thing in itself. Yet it is real because it is a manifestation of God in Himself and God who is satyam conceives nothing that is not satyam, nothing that is not Himself. He is not a seer of falsehoods. Anritam is merely a vikara or perversion of satyam. All ignorance is really partial or misplaced knowledge, all bondage a concealment of freedom, all evil good in the making, all sorrow a veiled delight. This the Saguna Brahman perceives and knows and as Vasudeva, or tranquil Personality, He utterly enjoys without any distinction of pleasure and grief, good and evil, the infinite play of the world within Himself. The Saguna is Sacchidananda envisaging cosmic activity. On the tranquillity [of] Vasudeva God by a new adhyaropa manifests Himself to Himself as the Sarvam Brahman in all things; He becomes the Lilamaya, the eternal Child frolicking in the Universe, the Playmate, Lover, Master, Teacher and Friend of all His creations; He is Hari, He is Srikrishna, He is the Personal God whom we love and adore and whom we pursue and seize through the Ages. Then, descending a step farther, avataran, He is known to Himself not only as the universal Lord of the Lila, but as the individual, Narayana concealed in Nara, playing through him, different from him, one with him. Many Adwaitins of the Kaliyuga insist that God is a myth and only the Sad Atman is a reality, just as many Buddhists deny the Sad Atman as well and say that only the Asad is a reality, but if we know only the Sad Atman or only the Asad, if we follow after only the Nirguna or only the Saguna, if we only embrace Vasudeva-Krishna-Narayan, then we know not the Eternal except in an aspect and we fall under the censure of the Upanishad, dabhram evapi twam vettha Brahmano rupam. We must shut our eyes upon nothing, renounce nothing as absolutely false or illusive if we would know the All and be perfectly liberated. Only when we gaze we must gaze aright and see God in all things, not things as aught but God. Our fathers did not commit the error of sectarianism or a partial philosophy. They were mighty as Gods or Titans, not like the men of the Kali Yuga who shout and quarrel over their imperfect philosophies and little bounded religions; their souls were spacious enough to take in all truth for their portion.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">In this Brahman then, on the sure foundation of this free and disinterested Atman, in the joy and infinity of this Lila consciousness manifests its sevenfold nature and its sevenfold regions. We are already aware in our human progress of the three lower levels of consciousness; the vyahritis of the Veda, Bhur, Bhuvar and Swar, planes in which we wander in the shadow of the Ajnanam lighted by a broken sunlight from above, erring under the control of Avidya who separated from her eternal companion and playmate Vidya and at strife with that glorious friend and helper stumbles about among the appearances of the world, ourselves always dissatisfied, always struggling, always seeking a good that we cannot grasp and crying out at the end, “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity &amp; vexation of spirit.” But in that too we cannot rest; for God condemns us to our own good and spurs us on ever to seek until we find the missing element [that] can complete the incompleteness of our existence. Meanwhile the soul imagining itself irrevocably bound, contents itself with the things of its prisonhouse and wears its chains as ornaments or else, touched by God and uplifted, delights to struggle upward to freedom. For above the three Vyahritis is the fourth, Mahas, where the soul is one with God, yet separate, free, yet consciously plays with bondage, — Mahas, the link between the Parardha and Aparardha, pouring the glory of the higher hemisphere into the lower, — Mahas which we enjoy and possess in the golden ages of our humanity, love and seek for in the iron. For to Mahas we rise, through Mahas we aspire to the perfect oneness of Sacchidananda.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">Brahman at first becomes involved in gross matter, — he becomes or seems to become Annam, the conscious principle of Bhu. In pure Annam consciousness is involved, implicit, latent; from annam it has to develop or manifest the other six principles and this development or manifestation is the evolution of the modern Jadavadins. It develops them here, under the law of the universal harmony, in annam and the Jadavadins perceiving this principle of evolution, imagine not unnaturally that it is annam which is evolving and suppose the other six, even Mind, to be mere changes and movements of annam. At first prana or vitality which is latent in the metal, manifests in the tree; then mind which is latent in the tree manifests in the animal, first as chitta or mere receptive consciousness, then as manas or sensational consciousness without any self-conscious centre of individuality, then as the discriminatory faculty or buddhi with its companion Ahankara, egoism, the self-conscious principle. In the animals reason is awake, but elementary and has to be largely replaced by vijnanam, intuitive faculty manifesting not in intellect but in sensational &amp; vital consciousness. Then in man discriminative reason takes the lead, for discriminative reason is the shadow of the vijnanam, the link between the animal and the god and it is not till a fit body is formed for the works of reason that the spiritual evolution begins and the development of the higher states of consciousness is possible. Man is that fit body, sukritam eva, well indeed and beautifully made as a habitation for the gods. His business is to raise the animal in him and develop beyond manomaya being, transcending &amp; subordinating even its crown and glory which he considers his peculiar privilege, the discriminative and imaginative reason. For he has to develop vijnanam or ideal thought on which all Veda is based, he has to develop Ananda, Chit and Sat, the higher hemisphere of cosmic consciousness. In the present stage of his evolution he can only develop consciously as far as Ananda with Sat &amp; Chit implicit in Ananda; to Chit &amp; Sat proper he cannot arrive in his waking state, but only in the deep trance of Sushupta Samadhi, concentration of consciousness in a state of illuminated Sleep. He began his task as the supreme animal, Pashu, Vanara, Nrisingha, developing all these potentialities purely in the annamaya kosha or physical sheath of his being in Annam &amp; Prana; he went on as the mixed animal, first the Pishacha or scientific, curious animal, then the Pramatha or aesthetic, curious animal; and from these levels climbed to the condition of the Rakshasa or animal-god who satisfies egoism through his sensational and emotional impulses; he is now the Asura, Titan or demi-god satisfying in the heart &amp; buddhi his emotional and intellectual egoism. He has eventually to become the whole god; he must learn to satisfy himself without egoism through ideal knowledge and blissful spirituality. But always being in the annamaya world, in Bhu, resting always on the Anna Atma, he is compelled to base himself on the body even when rising above the body. The individual may leave the body, but the race has to keep it; it has not to leave the animal in humanity behind in its progress but to raise the animal until it is divine. It is his first business therefore to be conscious not only in the physical sheaths of the Annakosha and Pranakosha, — this he normally is, — but in the mental sheath or manahkosha, and there in his normal condition he is only partially active. Once awake in the mental body, he has to extend his waking consciousness, — whoever can so far develop, — into the Vijnana and Anandakoshas.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">What are these bodies and these Atmas? The Vedantins of old recognised that divine consciousness on whatever level always creates for itself through Prakriti or Chit, its active creative knowledge, a world to live in &amp; a body for its habitation in the world, and in that world and in that body manifests as a part of the Atman reflecting their conditions. If therefore there are seven distinct states of consciousness, there must equally be seven conditions of the Atman, seven distinct worlds with their denizens and seven kinds of bodies. These seven states are Annam, Prana, Manas, Vijnanam, Ananda, Chit and Sat; these seven worlds are Bhuloka, Bhuvarloka, Swarloka, Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka and Satyaloka; these seven conditions of the Atman are the Visva Atma, Prana Atma, Buddha Atma, Mahan Atma, Mahajana Atma, Chaitanya Atma and Satya Atma; these seven bodies are the Annakosha, Pranakosha, Manahkosha, Vijnanakosha, Anandakosha, Chitkosha and Satkosha. In each world the denizens, although living predominatingly in the body proper to their own element of conscious existence, also live latently or consciously in the other six, and all have therefore seven bodies, each in communication with its proper plane or world &amp; containing its proper principle of consciousness. Man, living here in the Bhu, has, he too, his seven bodies. He has for instance the Manahkosha containing his pure mental consciousness and, although mind can &amp; does play in the other sheaths, it can only be by becoming awake &amp; living in his mental body as well as his physical that he can realise the utmost potentialities of pure mental activity. It is because he has these other bodies, that he can, if he will, communicate with the other worlds and have relations with the Gods.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">This then is the arrangement of the created universe, and the world we live in is its base, not only earth but all these sidereal systems, Bhuloka, the material universe, our present inheritance. Being the lowest of the Aparardha worlds, it is according to a common action of God’s love and wisdom, at once the least and the most privileged, the least privileged because here alone grief and pain are utterly felt, here alone is the whole pain and struggle of evolution, — the most privileged because here alone is the evolution eventually complete in all the potentiality of its parts and heaven perfectly realised in a sevenfold blissfulness. Above us are the six other worlds, homes of the gods who change not ever, except by entering human bodies. First, there is Bhuvar, the Pranamaya world, where Prana is at its height, vitality is stupendous, grief and pain are felt but enjoyed, sensuous enjoyment is perfect and prolonged. Then there is Swar, lower &amp; higher, Swarga and Chandraloka, where Indra and the greater gods reside, manas is at its height, sensation, emotion, aesthetic pleasure and intellectual joy are of a mighty intensity, grief and pain are not felt except as another kind of pleasure and rapture, mental enjoyment is perfect and prolonged. Above there is Mahas or Suryaloka where vijnanam is at its height, intuitive ideal perception, inspiration &amp; revelation are the normal processes of knowledge and the joys of ideal and direct knowledge unmixed with falsehood and error are perfect and prolonged. It is this state of consciousness which is so often called in the Veda, satyam, ritam, brihat and technically termed Bhuma, Mahas or Mahat, the abundant, full or mighty. These are the worlds of the lower hemisphere and of these states of consciousness we can have some conception, we can imagine and even realise or almost realise the condition of the beings who reside in these worlds, to the very highest. But what of the three supreme states of consciousness? what of the three worlds of the higher hemisphere? It is more difficult to conceive of them or to realise what man himself will be or is when he develops them — is, for even now by Yoga he can develop the Ananda. Still, because, debarred though we are from the actual tread of these infinite heavens, we can experience them indirectly and as conditioned by our existence on these lower levels, therefore some idea of them, not altogether inadequate, may be formed by those of us who have a touch of the ideal faculty.</p>

<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The suffix <span class="unicod_norm">न्</span> is nominal, adjectival and verbal, and as an adjectival or nominal suffix denotes substance or actuality; it uses, like all other such suffixes, the enclitics <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">उ</span> to connect it with the root or with the termination or additional suffix or with both or neither.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The root <span class="unicod_norm">अग्</span> is a secondary formation from the primary old Aryan root <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span> which means essentially to be or, transitively, to have. <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span> expresses being in its widest and barest sense without any idea of substance or attribute. The sound <span class="unicod_norm">ग्</span> suggests application, contact or a gentle force or insistence. Combining with <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span> it gives the sense of being or having with an application of force to action, to men, to things and easily acquires significations on the one hand of strength, force, excellence, preeminence, brilliance, on the other of gentle contact, love, possession. Illustrative derivates are Latin and Greek <span class="unicod_txt">ago</span>, <span class="greek_txt">ἄγω</span>, to lead, drive, act; stir; move; <span class="greek_txt">ἀγαθός</span>, excellent, good; S. <span class="unicod_norm">अग्र</span>, foremost, in front, Gr. <span class="greek_txt">ἄϰρος</span>, top, <span class="greek_txt">ἀϰμή</span>, extreme height, <span class="greek_txt">ἀϰτή</span>, extreme limit, border, coast; <span class="greek_txt">ἄγαν</span>, excessively (O.A. <span class="unicod_norm">अगाम्</span>); <span class="greek_txt">ἀγανός</span>, brilliant, graceful, gentle; <span class="greek_txt">ἀγλαός</span>, brilliant; <span class="greek_txt">Ἄγις</span>, <span class="greek_txt">Ἀγαμέμνων</span>; <span class="greek_txt">ἀγαπάω</span>, I love, prefer; ager, a possession, field; <span class="unicod_norm">अगस्ति</span>, and with the nasal, <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्ग्</span> , making the root <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्ग्</span> , to stir, move, walk; <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्ग</span>, beloved, distinguished; afterwards used only, from the two senses, as a respectful, yet affectionate mode of address; <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्गति</span>, fire (also a conveyance, cf <span class="unicod_txt">ago</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्ग्</span>), <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्गारः</span>, a live coal, <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्गिरः</span>, from the sense of brilliant, forceful, distinguished, preeminent, foremost. The word Agni therefore means the strong, brilliant, mighty, and may always suggest along with this, its proper signification as determined by usage, an allusion to its other possible sense of “loving” or “loveable”.

The sound <span class="unicod_norm">ल्</span> is the shabda of love, desire, entreaty, gentle and wooing touch; it expresses softness, sweetness, desire, and by a development passion, intensity, force of the heart. Combining with <span class="unicod_norm">ई</span> it gives the sense of close adherence, to embrace, cling to, love, adore, approach with love or adoration; of pressure, to crowd, press, pack, press together, make compact or strong; of maternal production, motherhood, to bear, produce, give birth to. It has also the primary senses of motion, to go, move, cast, strike; and by a development from the sense of clinging or persistence in a given place, the opposite idea of motionlessness, rest, — to rest still, lie, sleep. Its derivates are <span class="unicod_norm">इला</span> meaning mother and applied to the earth, a cow, Speech; <span class="unicod_norm">इलिका</span>, earth; <span class="unicod_norm">इली</span>, a short sword or stick; and from the almost identical root <span class="unicod_norm">इड्</span> or <span class="unicod_norm">ईड्</span> , the nouns <span class="unicod_norm">इड्</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">इडा</span> having the same meanings, and also the meaning “libation, offering, that which is cast or thrown on the altar or earth”, “a draught, ie what is taken down at a cast into the throat”, “heaven”, the place of bliss, love and delight; (<span class="unicod_norm">इड्</span> also means people or subjects, from another sense, to control, master, rule, cf <span class="unicod_norm">ईश्</span>); <span class="unicod_norm">इडः</span> as an epithet of Agni; <span class="unicod_norm">ईडा</span>, love, desire, prayer or praise; <span class="unicod_norm">ईडनम्</span> , adoration; <span class="unicod_norm">ईड्य</span> or <span class="unicod_norm">ईडेन्य</span>, adorable, desirable.

<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">यज्</span> is a derivative from the primary root <span class="unicod_norm">य</span> which has the essential significances of motion to or from, yearning, contact and union. The sound <span class="unicod_norm">ज्</span> adds to it the idea of sharply applied and decisive or effective force in the motion, desire or contact. Hence it gets the meaning of effort, seeking after, wooing, application to, adhesion, or strongly maintained union or contact. The sense of successful effort gives that of mastery. Cf <span class="unicod_norm">यम्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">यत्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">यस्</span> (<span class="unicod_norm">आयासः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">रयासः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">यमः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">नियमः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">यत्न</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">यति</span>). It means in its nominals labour, action, control, mastery, Yoga, and when used transitively, ruler, master, Yogin. The word <span class="unicod_norm">यमः</span> had the same significance. In another sense, to cast before, hand over to, cf <span class="unicod_norm">यच्छ्</span> , it means to give, offer, sacrifice. A third sense is to woo, court, worship, adore, cf Gr. <span class="greek_txt">ἰάλλω</span>, to desire. <span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञः</span> may therefore mean either, the Master, the Almighty, the Lord, Vishnu, Ishwara; or, action, or yoga; or, sacrifice. All three senses have to be taken into consideration in the Veda. Here and ordinarily it means Ishwara, the Lord.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">देवम् । </span>Root <span class="unicod_norm">दिव्</span> compounded after modification with the nominal and adjectival suffix <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span>, which gives simply and vaguely the sense of being.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The root <span class="unicod_norm">दिव्</span> or <span class="unicod_norm">दीव्</span> has two common senses, to play or sport and to shine, besides some of the significances common to <span class="unicod_norm">द्</span> roots, viz, to strike, throw; hurt, cause to suffer, vex, torment, harass; destroy; squander, give (<span class="unicod_norm">द</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">दा</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">दान</span>). The sense of to play, gamble, to sport, gambol, rejoice, etc is its most characteristic significance. The sense of shining comes from the sense of coruscation, brilliance caused by light playing brilliantly, vibrating powerfully. The Gods are therefore primarily those who rejoice, to whom life is play, lila or ananda — their occupations being described in the Smriti by the significant expression <span class="unicod_norm">देवानुक्रीडनम्</span> . Deva subsequently came to have the sense, luminous or flashingly brilliant, jyotirmaya, attached to it; also, heavenly, from <span class="unicod_norm">दिव्</span> the shining or blissful regions, and was used in the ancient language in all these senses, the associations of which have come down to us in the modern sense of <span class="unicod_norm">देव</span> . The gods are the jyotirmaya beings of the tejomaya, luminous Chandraloka or Swar and jyotirmaya, brilliant Suryaloka or Mahar, the two heavens attainable by mortals.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्विजम् । </span>An ancient compound word <span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">विज्</span> formed in the early childhood of the language before the modern laws of Sandhi were applied.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्</span> is the root <span class="unicod_norm">ऋ</span> with the verbal and nominal suffix <span class="unicod_norm">त्</span> expressing either action or quality. <span class="unicod_norm">ऋ</span> signifies essentially to move or go vibratingly straight or swift to a mark. It means to go, to go straight; to attempt, attack; reach, acquire; master, know; think. Hence various meanings for its derivatives, eg <span class="unicod_norm">ऋक्थं</span> acquisitions, wealth; <span class="unicod_norm">ऋध्</span> to flourish, prosper; <span class="unicod_norm">ऋद्धिः</span>; <span class="unicod_norm">ऋष्टिः</span> a weapon, sword; <span class="unicod_norm">ऋक्ण</span> wounded, etc; but the common meaning is based on the idea of straightness, fixity, directness, truth, knowledge, as in <span class="unicod_norm">ऋजु</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">ऋतम्</span> (truth, law, rule), <span class="unicod_norm">ऋतु</span> (fixed time, season; order, rule); <span class="unicod_norm">ऋषि</span>, knower, thinker, Latin <span class="unicod_txt">reor</span>, I think, <span class="unicod_txt">ratio</span>, reason, etc; <span class="unicod_norm">ऋभु</span> , wise, adept, expert. The word <span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्</span> here means truth or law.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">विज्</span> is a derivative root from the important primary root <span class="unicod_norm">वि</span>, which has essentially the significance of coming into existence, so to appear, open, separate, be discerned. These meanings can be traced through a host of derivatives in Sanscrit, Latin and Tamil. From the sense of appearing, being open, we get transitively the meaning to see, know, Latin <span class="unicod_txt">video</span>, Greek <span class="greek_txt">εῖδον</span>, <span class="greek_txt">οῖδα</span>, <span class="greek_txt">ἴσθι</span>, etc; (cf Tamil <span class="tamil_txt">விளங்ஞ</span>  to give light, shine; <span class="tamil_txt">விழி</span>  eye); Sanscrit <span class="unicod_norm">दिद्</span> . The form <span class="unicod_norm">दिद्</span> implies successful, decisive, complete or spontaneous sight or knowledge. <span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्विज्</span> is therefore the knower of truth, the drashta of the Veda, Agni jatavedas, or the adept in law and rule. In the latter sense it came to mean a sacrificial priest versed in the rules of the sacrifice. The later Nirukta, fixing on the sense of priesthood, the only one then known, very naturally derived it from <span class="unicod_norm">ऋतु</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">इज्</span> , sacrificing in season, which is the only possible combination by modern rules and arrives at the right meaning by another road.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">होतारम् । </span>Root <span class="unicod_norm">हु</span> after modification with the verbal termination <span class="unicod_norm">तृ</span>.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The essential significance of <span class="unicod_norm">ह्</span> roots, <span class="unicod_norm">हा</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">हि</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">हु</span>, is violent contact, movement, application of force. Their primary meanings are to strike, dash, hit, destroy, slay; then, to cast, throw, hurl, fling; then, to hurl forth the voice, shout, call. The sense of abandonment, the sense of casting a libation on the altar, and other derivate senses are of later origin. <span class="unicod_norm">होता</span> in the old Aryan tongue meant a slayer, striker, destroyer, warrior; <span class="unicod_norm">हवः</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">आहवः</span> meant slaughter, battle, war; <span class="unicod_norm">हविः</span> slaying, strife; <span class="unicod_norm">हु</span> to hurl, fight, shout, call, invoke assistance (cf Grk <span class="greek_txt">βοή</span>, <span class="greek_txt">βοηθέω</span>). The sacrificial application is of later origin and belongs to the Dwapara Yuga, the age of sacrifice and ceremonial.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">रत्नधातमम् । रत्न</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">धा</span> with the superlative termination <span class="unicod_norm">तम</span>.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The word <span class="unicod_norm">रत्न</span> is the word <span class="unicod_norm">रत्</span> with the adjectival &amp; nominal suffix <span class="unicod_norm">न</span> expressing quality or substance. The root is <span class="unicod_norm">र</span> which has as its essential significance vibration, swift repeated action, tremulous, eager or impetuous contact, shock or motion, and its characteristic significance, to play, enjoy, sport, take delight; to love, embrace etc; also, to shine, coruscate, shed lustre. It and its derivatives also mean to rule, govern, protect; to fight, attack; set to, begin; to move rapidly, shout loud, make a noise. The word <span class="unicod_norm">रत्</span> had several of these meanings, but chiefly delight, enjoyment, love, sexual pleasure, passion, lustre, brilliance, and <span class="unicod_norm">रत्न</span> therefore means delightful, brilliant, and as a noun delight, ananda, or lustre. It is in later Sanscrit that it took the sense of jewel, from the adjectival sense, brilliant.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">धा</span> is the root <span class="unicod_norm">धा</span> to arrange, place, dispose, used as an adjective or noun. <span class="unicod_norm">रत्नधा</span> therefore means disposer of delight, <span class="unicod_norm">रत्नधातमम्</span> , mightiest disposer of delight.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">पूर्वेभिः । </span>Root <span class="unicod_norm">पुर्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">पूर्</span> previously explained under the first sloka and the suffix <span class="unicod_norm">व</span> which indicates substance, possession or being. Originally the word meant protecting, covering, in front, anterior, and by transference from place to time former, ancient, <span class="unicod_norm">पुरातन</span>. It had also the sense of first, foremost, best, leading, chief. Here the sense is ancient, those that were before.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">ऋषिभिः । </span>Root <span class="unicod_norm">ऋ</span> to think, reach, know forming the intensitive derivative <span class="unicod_norm">ऋष्</span> , to know, reach or acquire thoroughly or finally, with the nominal suffix <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span> expressing action or possession. The rishi is one who knows, possesses, has reached or acquired knowledge, an adept, <span class="unicod_norm">आप्त</span>, master. (Cf the German word <span class="unicod_txt">reich</span>, English <span class="unicod_txt">rich</span>, O.S. <span class="unicod_norm">ऋश्</span>). See under <span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्विजम्</span> in the first sloka.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">ईड्यो । </span>Root <span class="unicod_norm">ईड्</span> to love, desire, with the possessive or qualitative suffix <span class="unicod_norm">य</span> used either actively or passively; here passively = desirable, adorable. See under <span class="unicod_norm">ईळे</span> in the first sloka.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">नूतनैः । </span>Root <span class="unicod_norm">नु</span> or <span class="unicod_norm">नू</span> with the suffix <span class="unicod_norm">तनः</span> from root <span class="unicod_norm">तन्</span> meaning to hold, possess, contain (<span class="unicod_txt">tenere</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">terra</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">तनुः</span>) and therefore expressing a quality.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The root <span class="unicod_norm">नु</span> means to come forward, appear, come into being, come in, enter, penetrate, push in or forward, move forward, sail, walk etc. It belongs to the <span class="unicod_norm">न्</span> family of roots, whose essential signification is birth, manifestation, presence, appearance, entry, motion forward, progress (cf <span class="unicod_norm">नः</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">nos</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">nascere</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">nare</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">natare</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">नौः</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">nauta</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">नट्</span> meaning in Tamil to walk, <span class="unicod_norm">नि</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">नुद्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">नदः</span>) and from the sense of birth or new appearance or arrival acquires the sense of newness, in <span class="unicod_norm">नवः</span>, Latin <span class="unicod_txt">novus</span>, Gr. <span class="greek_txt">νέος</span>. The adverb <span class="unicod_norm">नु</span> or <span class="unicod_norm">नू</span>, meaning now, (cf the particle <span class="unicod_norm">नु</span>, Grk <span class="greek_txt">νυ</span>, Latin <span class="unicod_txt">nunc</span>, which properly means now, now then, then) takes the adjectival suffix <span class="unicod_norm">तन</span> to signify the quality of newness; — like <span class="unicod_norm">पुरा</span> of old, <span class="unicod_norm">पुरातन</span> old, <span class="unicod_norm">चिरं</span> long, <span class="unicod_norm">चिरन्तनः</span> lasting, eternal.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">उत । </span>Also. This is a particle which has survived from the ancient Aryan tongue. It belongs to the class represented [by] the Latin <span class="unicod_txt">et</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">ut</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">at</span>, Sanscrit <span class="unicod_norm">इद्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">उ</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">उत</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">अति</span>, Greek <span class="greek_txt">ι</span> at the end of a word for emphasis, <span class="greek_txt">οὑτοσί</span>, Bengali ই, ও, (তুমিই, তুমিইও). They are all based on the original particles <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">उ</span>, meaning, “this here”, “this there”, “that”, and used for distinction, emphasis, addition, connection; with the addition of the definitive sound <span class="unicod_norm">त्</span> , they formed <span class="unicod_norm">अत्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">इत्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">उत्</span> , which again by the addition of the emphatic <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span>, formed <span class="unicod_norm">अति</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">इति</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">उति</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">अत</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">इत</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">उत</span>. From these words a number of pronouns, adverbs, suffixes, affixes, conjunctions and prepositions are descended in the Aryan languages.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">उत</span> has the force as an adverb of also, in addition, verily, much more, quite as much, indeed, or of course, according to the context and spirit of the passage or phrase in which it occurs.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">स ।</span> The static root <span class="unicod_norm">स</span>, signifying existence in rest, used as a pronoun, expresses a fixed object resting before the eyes. It is the original of the Greek article, <span class="greek_txt">ὁ</span>, <span class="greek_txt">ἡ</span>, <span class="greek_txt">τό</span>, the Greek relative <span class="greek_txt">ὅς</span> (O.S. <span class="unicod_norm">सः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">सा</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">स</span>), cf <span class="greek_txt">ὅτι</span> because, and in the old Aryan and Vedic languages had not only the demonstrative force, but also when connecting two clauses, the relative or copulative. Here it is the causal relative who, because, and connects <span class="unicod_norm">ईड्यो</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">वक्षति</span>. <span class="unicod_norm">वक्षति</span> gives the reason for <span class="unicod_norm">ईड्यो</span>. Adorable or desirable because he habitually bears.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">देवाँ ।</span> The nasal at the end of a word in old Aryan tended always to be a pure nasal, anuswara, as in French, just as <span class="unicod_txt">s</span> final tended to become a pure aspiration, visarga. This is the reason for the metrical peculiarity by which final <span class="unicod_txt">s</span> in old Latin and final <span class="unicod_txt">m</span> both in old and classical Latin become silent and are elided before a vowel or do not affect the quantity of the syllable in the prosody of a verse. The later tendency was to materialise the sound.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">एह ।</span> The spirit of the sound <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span> is a certain narrowness and intensity. The root accordingly easily acquires an association of force and strength in action; it easily forms derivatives like <span class="unicod_norm">ईर्</span> to force out, utter, <span class="unicod_norm">इरस्यति</span> to be angry, hostile, Latin <span class="unicod_txt">ira</span>, anger, Gr. <span class="greek_txt">ἵημι</span>, I throw, <span class="greek_txt">ἴσχω</span>, to control, rule, and in certain forms compounded with strong sounds like <span class="unicod_norm">ह</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">प</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">भ</span> or even with soft sounds like <span class="unicod_norm">न</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">ल</span> it has the pure idea of strength, cf S. <span class="unicod_norm">इन्द्रः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">इन्द्रियम्</span> , Gr. <span class="greek_txt">ἴφιος</span>, <span class="greek_txt">ἴφθιμος</span>, <span class="greek_txt">ἰσχύς</span>, <span class="greek_txt">ἴς</span> (<span class="greek_txt">ἰνός</span> G.), <span class="unicod_norm">इष्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">ईश्वरः</span>. From this sense of the root <span class="unicod_norm">इह्</span> is formed <span class="unicod_norm">इह्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">एह्</span> , substantives meaning strength, force, with an old form of the dwitiya or accusative case <span class="unicod_norm">एह</span> used adverbially to mean strongly, forcibly, with strength. (The derivation of <span class="unicod_norm">इह</span>, here, is different and it was by an error that this sense was extended to the archaic word <span class="unicod_norm">एह</span> by the later grammarians on the analogy of <span class="unicod_norm">इव</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">एव</span> etc.)</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">वक्षति ।</span> Root <span class="unicod_norm">वह्</span> in the derivative <span class="unicod_norm">वक्ष्</span> (<span class="unicod_norm">वह्</span> + <span class="unicod_norm">स्</span>), to bear habitually. The suffix <span class="unicod_norm">स</span> or <span class="unicod_norm">क्ष</span> added to a root gave three senses, intention or futurity, desire, or frequency and habit. It is in the last sense that it occurs here and forms words like <span class="unicod_norm">वस्</span> to dwell (be or occupy habitually), <span class="unicod_norm">वक्षः</span> breast, <span class="unicod_norm">लक्ष्</span> to notice, observe; <span class="unicod_norm">ऋक्ष</span> star, constellation, etc, <span class="unicod_norm">इरस्यति</span>. In the former sense <span class="unicod_norm">स्</span> forms the future in Greek and Sanscrit.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The root <span class="unicod_norm">वह्</span> is derivative from the primary root <span class="unicod_norm">व</span> in its sense of “be in space &amp; substance, hold matter, contain, bear”. It also means to bring, carry, sweep, lead.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">रयिम् ।</span> From the sense of vibration and motion in the root <span class="unicod_norm">र</span>, the word being the root <span class="unicod_norm">र</span> + the nominal suffix <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">य</span> a merely connective semivowel between two vowels as in <span class="unicod_norm">जाये</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">म्रिये</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">मन्ये</span> (<span class="unicod_norm">मँये</span>). Sanscrit has lost, Tamil has preserved this connective use of the semivowels <span class="unicod_norm">य</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">व</span> as a constant rule of its system of euphony. <span class="unicod_norm">रयिः</span> is that which vibrates, moves, is in constant play; it comes therefore to signify substance, matter, force, energy, strength, prosperity, play, delight, laughter, with other kindred or derivative senses. It is the Latin <span class="unicod_txt">res</span>, “thing, affair, object, matter, fact”. In the sense of substance or matter it is constantly used in the Veda. In this passage it means substance or force of substance.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">अश्नुवत् ।</span> Root <span class="unicod_norm">अश्</span> to have or enjoy, with the connective verbal affix <span class="unicod_norm">नु</span> and the impersonal adjectival or participial termination <span class="unicod_norm">वत्</span> . We find this general use of <span class="unicod_norm">व</span> in Tamil with the verbal stem to indicate a verbal adjective, “one who enjoys”. The root <span class="unicod_norm">अश्</span> is a secondary root from <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span> in its transitive sense “to have”. It is the same word as the Greek <span class="greek_txt">ἔχω</span>, I have (<span class="unicod_norm">अशा</span>), and from the sense of possession develops other significances, to eat, enjoy, etc. <span class="unicod_norm">अश्नुवत्</span> is in this passage “one enjoys.”</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">पोषम् ।</span> Stem <span class="unicod_norm">पुष्</span> modified with the nominal suffix <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span>. <span class="unicod_norm">पुष्</span> is a habitual, frequentative or desiderative form from <span class="unicod_norm">पु</span>, to produce, beget, possess, protect (see under <span class="unicod_norm">पुरो</span> in the first sloka) and develops the sense “to nourish, rear, increase”. It also means “to perfect, develop”, and “to cherish, foster, love”. Cf <span class="unicod_norm">पुत्र</span>, Latin, <span class="unicod_txt">pullus</span>; <span class="unicod_norm">पूषा</span> the Sun; <span class="unicod_norm">पूज्</span> to worship, adore, developed from the sense of cherishing or loving. The substantive <span class="unicod_norm">पोषः</span> means, therefore, “increase, development, increasing, perfection”.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">एव ।</span> The pronominal and adverbial particle <span class="unicod_norm">व</span> (still used for the second personal pronoun plural as <span class="unicod_norm">न</span> is used for the first) meant originally “a substantial object, a thing before the eyes”. It came to mean, especially when compounded with <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">उ</span>, thus, this way, in that direction; cf <span class="unicod_norm">इव</span>, originally meaning, “so”, then, “as”; <span class="unicod_norm">अव</span> in that direction, in the direction of, then, down to, down; <span class="unicod_norm">वै</span>, so indeed, verily, <span class="unicod_norm">वा</span> “or”, originally meaning “so”, “and”, “or”. <span class="unicod_norm">एव</span> is merely a variant of <span class="unicod_norm">इव</span> giving a vaguer and more comprehensive sense. It was used formerly with its other form <span class="unicod_norm">इवम्</span> to mean, “so, and”, the latter significance surviving in the Bengali এবং, and only afterwards came to mean “indeed, verily, that and no other, so and not otherwise”. In this passage it has the significance of “and, also”.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">दिवे ।</span> Root <span class="unicod_norm">दिव्</span> to shine, be bright, with the nominal suffix <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span>, “the bright period, day”, or “the bright world”, “heaven”. Here <span class="unicod_norm">दिवे</span> <span class="unicod_norm">दिवे</span> means “from day to day”.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">यशसम् ।</span> Root <span class="unicod_norm">यश्</span> with the nominal suffix <span class="unicod_norm">अस्</span> “enjoyment, satisfied possession”.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">यश्</span> is an intensitive derivative from <span class="unicod_norm">य</span>, to reach, join or embrace entirely, (see under <span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञः</span> in the first sloka) and meant “success, fame, glory, possession, mastery”. It also meant “enjoyment, a thing enjoyed or enjoyable, love, beauty, charm, splendour,” (cf <span class="unicod_norm">योषा</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">योषित्</span> , from <span class="unicod_norm">युष्</span>) which it subsequently lost, and “seat of enjoyment, the vital organs, heart, liver etc,” Latin, <span class="unicod_txt">jecur</span>.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">वीरवत्तमम् । वीर्</span> , manifestation from Root <span class="unicod_norm">वी</span>, with the adjectival suffix <span class="unicod_norm">वत्</span> and the superlative suffix <span class="unicod_norm">तमः</span>, from <span class="unicod_norm">त</span> in the sense of to stretch, extend; cf <span class="unicod_norm">तन्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">ततः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">तालः</span> etc. <span class="unicod_norm">तमः</span> means extensive, extreme, very, so “most”.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The roots <span class="unicod_norm">वि</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">वी</span> mean to open, expand, manifest, a sense chiefly found in the roots <span class="unicod_norm">विद्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">विल्</span> (Tamil, Sanscrit, Latin), cf also <span class="unicod_norm">आविः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">वियत्</span> , the open sky, B. বিজলি, lightning, Lat. <span class="unicod_txt">verus</span>, true etc, etc. From this sense it developed the idea of full and forceful manifestation, strength, energy, courage, heroism, Lat. <span class="unicod_txt">vis</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">vir</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">virtus</span>, Sanscrit <span class="unicod_norm">वीरः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">वीर्यं</span>. The word <span class="unicod_norm">वीर</span> is here plainly used as a substantive since it needs <span class="unicod_norm">वत्</span> to give it the adjectival sense. <span class="unicod_norm">वीर</span> means either “strength, force”, or “manifestation, splendour, openness, fullness”. With <span class="unicod_norm">यशः</span> in the sense of enjoyment goes most suitably the latter signification, “fullest, most expanded, unstinted”; but “forceful” would also not be inappropriate to the character and function of Agni.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">यम् ।</span> The demonstrative relative in the old Aryan tongue, <span class="unicod_norm">यः</span>, implies motion or direction from one point to another as opposed to the static force of <span class="unicod_norm">सः</span>. <span class="unicod_norm">यः</span> means the one who is yonder, <span class="unicod_norm">सः</span> the one who is here.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञम् ।</span> Yajna (the Lord, Isha) here refers to the Jivatman; the distinction from the universal Yajna is indicated in the epithet <span class="unicod_norm">अध्वरम्</span> .</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">अध्वरम् ।</span> This word is an adjective formed by the addition of the common adjectival suffix <span class="unicod_norm">र</span> to <span class="unicod_norm">अध्व</span> (<span class="unicod_norm">रुचिर</span> from <span class="unicod_norm">रुचि</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">असुर</span> from <span class="unicod_norm">असु</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">मधुर</span> from <span class="unicod_norm">मधु</span>). <span class="unicod_norm">अध्व</span> itself is a substantive formed by the root <span class="unicod_norm">अध्</span> by the direct addition of the nominal suffix <span class="unicod_norm">व</span>. Kindred vocables are <span class="unicod_norm">अधस्</span> , below, <span class="unicod_norm">अध्वन्</span> , path, distance, sky, attack, time, place, <span class="unicod_norm">अधम</span>, lowest, <span class="unicod_norm">अधर</span>, lower, <span class="unicod_norm">अधि</span>, originally meaning towards, down to, so from above, above, concerning (Gr. <span class="greek_txt">ϰατά</span>), <span class="unicod_norm">अधिक</span>, more, <span class="unicod_norm">आधिः</span>, pain, <span class="unicod_norm">अधिः</span>, pain, misfortune. <span class="unicod_norm">अध्वर</span> itself is used in later Sanscrit to mean, “lasting, uninterrupted, attentive, the sky or air, and a sacrificial ceremony”. All these significations are recognisable as developments from the original Aryan root <span class="unicod_norm">अध्</span> , a secondary formation from <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span>, to be. The sound <span class="unicod_norm">ध्</span> signifies dull contact, downward motion or pressure from above, rest, finality with an idea of tamasic condition, establishment, etc. <span class="unicod_norm">अध्</span> therefore means to oppress, cover, rest, descend and rest, reach and end, attack, etc. The air or atmosphere covering or pressing on the earth, place, Time and distance, as continents, grief as a dull tamasic condition, are early derivative meanings. The same relation viewed from two different standpoints creates the opposite senses of “down, lower”, <span class="unicod_norm">अधः</span> and “above, towards, more”, <span class="unicod_norm">अधि</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">अधिक</span>.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">अध्वरः</span> means lower, relative, individual, from the lost word <span class="unicod_norm">अध्व</span> which signified philosophically the lower planes of the universe, the aparardha, <span class="greek_txt">τὸ ἔνερθεν</span>. In relation to the word <span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञः</span>, adhwara signifies the Purusha, Lord or Ishwara manifesting in the aparardha and attached to an individual adhara; the Jivatman, not bound but relative in his manifestation.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">विश्वतः । विश्व</span>, root <span class="unicod_norm">श्व</span> to lie, remain, be spread out, with the prefix <span class="unicod_norm">वि</span> meaning open, outspread, diverse, manifold, and the suffix <span class="unicod_norm">तः</span> which expresses possession, relation or origin, commonly used to form adverbial expressions. On all sides.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">परिभूः । पर</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">परि</span> or <span class="unicod_norm">प्र</span>, all signifying in front, beyond, above, from in front, and afterwards variously for, to, towards, around, about, are kindred words from the root <span class="unicod_norm">प</span> to cover, protect. In the old language <span class="unicod_norm">परि</span> as preposition governs the second case even when it is part of a compound verb, adjective or noun; it had not at that time either become otiose or lost its separate existence in the compound, but was easily detachable and always bore its especial significance and power. <span class="unicod_norm">भूः</span> means “existent or in being”, <span class="unicod_norm">परि</span> “round about or in relation to”.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">असि । </span>Thou art. Root <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span> with the personal termination <span class="unicod_norm">सि</span>. In the old language there were two forms <span class="unicod_norm">अस्सि</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">असि</span> from the secondary <span class="unicod_norm">अस्</span> (<span class="unicod_norm">अस्मि</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">अस्ति</span>) and the primary <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span>; but the latter alone has survived.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">इद् । </span>The old enclitic <span class="unicod_norm">इत्</span> , kindred to <span class="unicod_norm">अत्</span> (Latin <span class="unicod_txt">et</span>) and <span class="unicod_norm">उत्</span> (Latin <span class="unicod_txt">ut</span>) and signifying that (Latin <span class="unicod_txt">id</span>), also, and, indeed, verily, the same (Lat. <span class="unicod_txt">idem</span>). Cf the use of <span class="unicod_norm">इति</span> answering to English “that”. “He, the same Yajna whom you surround as the individual soul, is also beyond that relation and universal.”</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">देवेषु । </span>The gods, as masters of the forces and functions, physical, mental and spiritual which surround with their activities and minister to the individual knowledge and action of the Jiva.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">गच्छति । </span>The secondary root <span class="unicod_norm">गच्छ्</span> from <span class="unicod_norm">ग</span> is used to form certain tenses of the verb <span class="unicod_norm">गम्</span> which has replaced both <span class="unicod_norm">ग</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">गच्छ्</span> . Cf <span class="unicod_norm">यच्छ्</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">यम्</span> from the primary root <span class="unicod_norm">य</span>. <span class="unicod_norm">ग</span> means originally to move softly or steadily, or continuously. It is the characteristic root for general motion as opposed to the more specific senses of <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">ऋ</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">या</span>, and conveys here the same sense of primary cosmic motion as in <span class="unicod_norm">जगत्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">जगती</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">गा</span> (the world or earth).</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">कविक्रतुः । कवि</span>. Root <span class="unicod_norm">कु</span> modified before a vowel with the nominal suffix <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span>. This root is only found in later Sanscrit in the modified form <span class="unicod_norm">कव्</span> , to praise or describe, to compose a poem, to paint a picture. The <span class="unicod_norm">क्</span> roots are among those of the widest scope in the Aryan language. Primarily, they convey the idea of any kind of violent, strong or masterful contact, action or relation to any thing, person or action. The root <span class="unicod_norm">कु</span> was used in the more ancient language in the sense of do, act, form, make, design, create. <span class="unicod_norm">को</span> in <span class="unicod_norm">कोविदः</span> is the substantive, meaning “art, practice”. It also meant to desire, enjoy (Lat. <span class="unicod_txt">cupio</span>, and from the idea of any strong passion connected with love <span class="unicod_norm">कुप्</span> to be angry, cf <span class="unicod_norm">कम्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">कामः</span>, <span class="greek_txt">ϰυέω</span>, to kiss, <span class="unicod_norm">कुमारः</span> etc), to master, seize, hold, contain, shut, confine, protect, imprison (<span class="unicod_norm">कवचः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कवसः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कवषः</span>, armour, a shield; <span class="unicod_norm">कवकः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कवलः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कवडः</span>, a mouthful; <span class="unicod_norm">कवरकी</span>, a prisoner; <span class="unicod_norm">कव्यं</span>, a handful, then the oblation to the Manes; <span class="unicod_norm">कुटं</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कुटी</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कुटीरः</span>; cf <span class="unicod_norm">कोशः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कोलः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कोरकः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कोशः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कोटः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कोटरः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कूलं</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कूपः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कुक्षिः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कुः</span>, earth). Various ideas of calling, crying, crying on or at, praising, reviling (<span class="unicod_norm">कु</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कू</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कूज्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">कूट्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">कुत्स्</span> etc). The idea of curve or crookedness derived from the sense of the circle (Gr <span class="greek_txt">ϰύϰλος</span>, <span class="greek_txt">ϰυλίνδω</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कुलं</span>, the circle, society, herd, race, family, <span class="unicod_norm">कुटिलः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कुह्</span> , to deceive, <span class="unicod_norm">कुच्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">कुटी</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">को</span> in <span class="unicod_norm">कोदण्डः</span> etc) is fairly common. On the other hand, the root very rarely accepts the more strong and violent senses common to the forms <span class="unicod_norm">क</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">कि</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">कृ</span>, but it has them sometimes as in <span class="unicod_norm">कुरु</span> a master, ruler or priest, <span class="unicod_norm">कुट्ट्</span> to cut, pound, burn etc. In the word <span class="unicod_norm">कवि</span> the sense of perfect creative action is dominant. <span class="unicod_norm">कवि</span> meant a poet, artist, scientist, craftsman, sage, anyone who was <span class="unicod_norm">कोविद</span>, who could deal perfectly with his material physical or intellectual. It also meant the art or science itself and so, wisdom, skill, mastery, proficiency. It is in this latter sense that it is used in the compound <span class="unicod_norm">कविक्रतुः</span>, “whose strength is in the mastery of knowledge”.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">क्रतु</span> is the Root <span class="unicod_norm">क्रत्</span> , a tertiary formation from <span class="unicod_norm">कृ</span> by modification of the vowel to <span class="unicod_norm">र</span>. The root <span class="unicod_norm">कृ</span> expresses action, work, mastery, strength, rule or any strong, violent or mastering activity, to cut, pierce, slaughter, hurt etc. <span class="unicod_norm">क्रतुः</span> meant strength, action, force, power of any kind mental or physical. It often meant the Will or any activity of the will. Cf Greek <span class="greek_txt">ϰράτος</span>, <span class="greek_txt">ϰάρτος</span>, <span class="greek_txt">ϰαρτερός</span>. The word <span class="unicod_norm">शतक्रतु</span> as a name of Indra meant not “he of the hundred sacrifices”, but he whose force was that of a hundred.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">सत्यम् । </span>True; free from the dwandwa of truth and falsehood. The root <span class="unicod_norm">स</span> to be in a fixed state or state of rest, to lie, rest, remain, be fixed, gives to <span class="unicod_norm">सत्</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">सत्य</span> the idea of that which is or is true, fact, reality, abidingness. <span class="unicod_norm">सत्य</span> is formed by the adjectival <span class="unicod_norm">य</span> from the old substantive <span class="unicod_norm">सत्</span> existence, truth, reality.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">चित्रश्रवस्तमः । चित्र</span>, Rt <span class="unicod_norm">चि</span> with the verbal suffix <span class="unicod_norm">त्र</span>. <span class="unicod_norm">चि</span> indicates fundamentally any action that cuts, splits, divides, separates or distinguishes. Its characteristic significance is to discern, distinguish, analyse, group, arrange and collect. Its verbal adjective <span class="unicod_norm">चित्र</span> means that which discerns, groups, arranges in a collection or that which is so discerned, grouped and arranged. It has the sense of various, variegated, decorative or decorated, well-arranged and assorted.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">श्रवः</span>, from the Root <span class="unicod_norm">श्रु</span>, to hear, modified, before the nominal suffix <span class="unicod_norm">अस्</span> . The word is the same as the Greek <span class="greek_txt">ϰλέος</span>, (<span class="greek_txt">ϰλύω</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">श्रुया</span>, I hear) and had in early times the sense of “fame, repute, renown”, but the sense “to move vibrating, react with a strong harmonious contact”, developing the sense, “to resort to, take refuge with, join” in <span class="unicod_norm">श्रि</span> and “to be heard, to hear” in <span class="unicod_norm">श्रु</span> are a yet more essential and original association. <span class="unicod_norm">श्रवः</span> means the thing heard, the thing received by revelation, knowledge, learning, belief, faith (cf <span class="unicod_norm">श्रद्धा</span>).</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">चित्रश्रवस्</span> means “analysed and grouped knowledge of great variety” or one who possesses such knowledge. Agni is he among the gods who possesses most such knowledge, proper to the vijnanam, ideal or purely ideative consciousness. He is <span class="unicod_norm">जातवेदाः</span>, the one who has the revealed knowledge, in whom and by whom it is born.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">आगमत् । </span>Root <span class="unicod_norm">गम्</span> to go, move, properly with a sense of direction, finality or intended or accomplished arrival. The preposition <span class="unicod_norm">आ</span> originally conveyed the idea of general relation; in this compound the sense of approach and arrival predominates. The preposition has no relation to the instrumental <span class="unicod_norm">देवेभिः</span>, which by itself implies union or accompaniment; <span class="unicod_txt">divus cum divis</span>, a god with the gods. The form <span class="unicod_norm">आगमत्</span> does not convey the idea of past time, but of general action, the time being vague, “arriveth”, whether now or habitually or as a past experience we have of him. It was from this vagueness that the form afterwards acquired an imperfect or habitual significance with regard to the past.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">यद् । </span>That. The demonstrative यत् like स was originally used either as a demonstrative pronoun or a relative and in the neuter as a conjunction; the transition from the relative to the conjunctional use is seen in this construction, where यत् is really the relative to the correlative तत् . यत् is a hanging introductory relative vaguely referring to the idea of the sentence भद्रं करिष्यसि and not a relative pronoun qualifying भद्रम् .</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">अङ्ग । See under अग्निम् in the first sloka.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">दासुषे</span> । Root दास् with the verbal suffix <span class="unicod_norm">ष्</span> preceded by enclitic <span class="unicod_norm">उ</span>, in a desiderative sense, the one who wishes to hurt, the enemy. The root <span class="unicod_norm">द</span> with its congeners <span class="unicod_norm">दा</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">दि</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">दी</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">दु</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">दू</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">दृ</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">दॄ</span>, expressed always effective, rapid and aggressive movement, contact, action etc. It had predominatingly an aggressive sense, in the beginning to cut, slay, tear, bite, divide; to destroy, ruin, waste, squander; to burn, pillage, havoc. Its most important derivatives as well as its less important, <span class="unicod_norm">दंश्</span> to bite, <span class="unicod_norm">दशनं</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">दत्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">दन्तः</span> tooth; <span class="unicod_norm">दक्ष्</span> to act quickly, hurt, kill (also to act or think ably); <span class="unicod_norm">दघ्</span> to kill, hurt; <span class="unicod_norm">दङ्घ्</span> to abandon (also, protect, cherish); <span class="unicod_norm">दंड्</span> to chastise; <span class="unicod_norm">दंभ्</span> to injure, hurt, deceive, drive; <span class="unicod_norm">दम्</span> to conquer, crush, tame; <span class="unicod_norm">दय्</span> to hurt, divide, as well as to love or pity; <span class="unicod_norm">दल्</span> to burst open, split, divide; <span class="unicod_norm">दवः</span> fire, heat, pain; <span class="unicod_norm">दस्</span> to toss up, destroy, perish; <span class="unicod_norm">दहर</span> wasted, thin; small and so young; <span class="unicod_norm">दह्</span> to burn, destroy, torment; <span class="unicod_norm">दा</span> to cut, divide, then, to give, its later though still ancient use; <span class="unicod_norm">दात्रम्</span> a sickle, <span class="unicod_norm">दाश्</span> to hurt, kill, give, grant, are all instances of the predominating frequency of this use. The same tendency may be found in the roots <span class="unicod_norm">दॄ</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">दू</span>, etc, but other significances were^ developed in them more frequently, and by a not infrequent irony of transmutation, the sense of loving, cherishing, protecting was developed from the sense of hurting, crushing, taming, and we find such words of tender import as <span class="unicod_norm">दमः</span>, house, Gr. <span class="greek_txt">δόμος</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">दानं</span>, the Persian <span class="unicod_norm">दिल्</span> (cf the name <span class="unicod_norm">दिलीप</span>), <span class="unicod_norm">दयिता</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">दया</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">दाराः</span>, etc as descendants of this root of violent or baleful significance. The word <span class="unicod_norm">दस्यु</span> in the Veda, meaning enemy, afterwards robber, <span class="unicod_norm">दासः</span>, a captured enemy, slave, (Gr. <span class="greek_txt">δοῦλος</span> from <span class="unicod_norm">दसुल</span>) are from the roots <span class="unicod_norm">दस्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">दास्</span> , meaning to hurt, afflict. <span class="unicod_norm">दासुषे</span> bears the same sense. There is no reason to take it in the later sense of “giver”.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">त्वम्</span> <span class="unicod_norm">। </span>Thou. <span class="unicod_norm">तु</span>, Lat. <span class="unicod_txt">tu</span>, Gr. <span class="greek_txt">σύ</span>, with the old definitive particle <span class="unicod_norm">अम्</span> . Cf <span class="unicod_norm">अहम्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">इदम्</span> , Lat. <span class="unicod_txt">idem</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">वयम्</span> from <span class="unicod_norm">व</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">यूयम्</span> from <span class="unicod_norm">यु</span> etc. The word <span class="unicod_norm">तु</span> is demonstrative, that there, like the plural <span class="unicod_norm">यु</span> (cf <span class="unicod_norm">यः</span>, the one who yonder) and was used by itself or with the suffix <span class="unicod_norm">व</span> (<span class="unicod_norm">त्व</span>) to indicate the second person.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">भद्रम् <span class="unicod_norm">। </span>The word भद्र from the root भ compounded with the noun द्र. It originally meant household wealth, from भ (<span class="unicod_norm">भवनं</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">भुवनम्</span>) being, a house, place, world, sky, etc, and द्र (<span class="unicod_norm">द्रव्य</span>) spoil, plunder, substance, possessions, wealth. From this sense it came to mean ease, happiness, good condition etc. Here it means simply “good”, its latest sense.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">करिष्यसि <span class="unicod_norm">। </span>Thou intendest or desirest to do. The future sense was originally one conveying the significance of intention, purpose, will, all conveyed by the sibilant suffixes <span class="unicod_norm">स</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">ष</span>. Cf “I will do” in English.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">तव <span class="unicod_norm">। </span>Originally possessive adjective from <span class="unicod_norm">तु</span>, thou.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">सत्यम् <span class="unicod_norm">। </span>Here in the sense of “nature”, “essential quality”, from सत् being with the adjectival <span class="unicod_norm">य</span>, belonging to the being, essential, real. It may also be taken in the sense of truth, which will have the same significance. The sense “oath, vow, promise”, would be out of place in the early language, though it would make good verbal sense, if the line stood by itself in some other context.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">अङ्गिरः । </span>Root <span class="unicod_norm">अग्</span> to love with the adjectival suffix <span class="unicod_norm">इर्</span> , makes <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्गिर्</span> the lover, loving, and from the adjectival sense loving, is formed a secondary substantive <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्गिरस्</span> , again meaning lover or one who loves. Agni as Angiras is the lord of love.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">उप । </span>उ with the sense to cover, pervade, उप, over, above, through, under, and from the sense of over, in the direction of, towards; from the sense of under, in subjection to, up to. उप has here the sense of approach by an inferior to a superior.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">दोषावस्</span> <span class="unicod_norm">। दोषा</span> darkness, tamas, from <span class="unicod_norm">दुष्</span> , to assail, attack, overcome, oppress, cover, darken, eclipse. <span class="unicod_norm">दोषा</span> or <span class="unicod_norm">दोः</span> also means the striking part of the arm, the forearm.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">अवस्</span> Root <span class="unicod_norm">अव्</span> with the nominal suffix <span class="unicod_norm">अस्</span> . <span class="unicod_norm">अव्</span> , a secondary formation from <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span>, to be in substance, (<span class="unicod_norm">व्</span> conveying the idea of substance, solidity, patent or objective existence), to be strong, strengthen, maintain, keep, cherish, protect, confirm, desire, love; to rise, soar, fly, be exalted.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">दोषावस्</span> he who strengthens, maintains or protects in the darkness.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">तर् <span class="unicod_norm">। </span>An old adverbial form still preserved in <span class="unicod_norm">तर्हि</span> and the Mahratti तर् , “so”; it meant there, then, thus, <span class="unicod_norm">इति</span>. Here it is used almost as a vocative “O!”</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">धिया <span class="unicod_norm">। </span>The essential meaning of the roots <span class="unicod_norm">ध</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">धा</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">धि</span>, is to set down, fix, place, settle, keep, hold. <span class="unicod_norm">धि</span> is that operation of the intellect which fixes, arranges and retains, the buddhi or discerning and judging intellect.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">वयम् <span class="unicod_norm">। </span>व with the definitive particle <span class="unicod_norm">अम्</span> connected by the semivowel <span class="unicod_norm">य</span>; cf <span class="unicod_norm">त्वम्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">यूयम्</span> (see under <span class="unicod_norm">त्वम्</span> in the sixth sloka). व was used for the plural of the pronoun both in the first and the second persons with a distinguishing prefix which was afterwards lost or replaced the व, न <span class="unicod_norm">वः</span> or नु <span class="unicod_norm">वः</span>, we, Latin, <span class="unicod_txt">nos</span>; य <span class="unicod_norm">व</span> or यु <span class="unicod_norm">वः</span>, you. When <span class="unicod_norm">यूयम्</span> replaced the second form, <span class="unicod_norm">वयम्</span> came to be restricted to the first pronoun.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">नमो <span class="unicod_norm">। </span>The root <span class="unicod_norm">नम्</span> means originally go or bring to an end or conclusion. To lead, guide, control, dispose, distribute, mark off, arrange, shape, bend, are its more common later meanings. The Greek <span class="greek_txt">νόμος</span>, law, <span class="greek_txt">νέμω</span>, to distribute, give, arrange, regulate, occupy or to pasture, graze; <span class="greek_txt">νέμος</span>, an apportioned ground or enclosure, so grove or pasturage; <span class="greek_txt">νέμεσις</span> (O.A. <span class="unicod_norm">नमतिः</span>) the goddess who arranges, controls, rewards, punishes, avenges; <span class="greek_txt">ὄνομα</span>, designation, name, (S. <span class="unicod_norm">नाम</span>), Lat. <span class="unicod_txt">nemus</span>, are survivals of these significations. In later Sanscrit only the intransitive sense of submission, being governed, ruled, subject, to bend, submit, bow, salute has left traces except in the sense, “to give”, attached to <span class="unicod_norm">नम्</span> , in the particle <span class="unicod_norm">नाम</span>, “granted”, “allowed”, “certainly”, and the substantive <span class="unicod_norm">नाम</span>, name. <span class="unicod_norm">नमो</span> means submission, self-surrender, <span class="unicod_norm">नतिः</span>; the later sense of salutation, obeisance does not apply to this passage.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">भरन्तः <span class="unicod_norm">। </span>The participle used in place of the finite verb; the use is almost that of a loose nominative absolute or an anacoluthon. Rt <span class="unicod_norm">भृ</span> (Gr. <span class="greek_txt">φέρω</span>, Lat. <span class="unicod_txt">fero</span>) with the verbal adjective or participial form of <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span>, to be. <span class="unicod_norm">भृ</span> means to occupy, fill, hold, uphold, bear, carry, contain, convey, bestow, be full of, feel within. It is used in this passage in the latter sense, to be full of.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">एमसि <span class="unicod_norm">। </span>There are two words, the locative of <span class="unicod_norm">एमस्</span> (Rt <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span> modified with the nominal suffix <span class="unicod_norm">मस्</span> signifying, “way, path”) and the second person of the verb <span class="unicod_norm">ईम्</span> or <span class="unicod_norm">एम्</span> , a final derivative from <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span>, to reach, to culminate, to grow to full strength. From this root comes <span class="unicod_norm">ईम्</span> , the intensive particle, meaning, utterly, actually, indeed, at once, now, and <span class="unicod_norm">इमथा</span>, as things actually are, now, under present circumstances, Lat. <span class="unicod_txt">imus</span>, uttermost, last, lowest. <span class="unicod_norm">एमसि</span> means, “thou culminatest, risest to thy full force”.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">राजन्तम् । </span>Rt <span class="unicod_norm">राज्</span> intensive form of <span class="unicod_norm">रा</span>, as <span class="unicod_norm">रज्</span> of <span class="unicod_norm">र</span> in the participial form. Like <span class="unicod_norm">र</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">रा</span> has chiefly the cognate senses of play, enjoyment, satisfaction, bounty, love, (<span class="unicod_norm">रागः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">राध</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">रात्रिः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">रामः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">रासः</span>, etc) and, to shine, glitter, colour etc. A third set of significations depend on the idea of darting on, seizing, pouncing on, — to seize, ravish, plunder, hold and keep, squeeze, subdue, rule, regulate, conquer, oppress, strike, rend etc (<span class="unicod_norm">रक्ष्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">रद्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">रध्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">रसः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">रक्षः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">रावण</span> etc, Lat. <span class="unicod_txt">rapio</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">rego</span>). We find <span class="unicod_norm">राज्</span> itself used in two senses, to shine or to rule, (cf <span class="unicod_norm">राजी</span>, a shining streak, line etc, <span class="unicod_norm">राजीव</span>, coloured blue lotus). He who rules, controls.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">अध्वराणाम् । </span><span class="greek_txt">τῶν νερτέρων</span>. Of things or beings in the lower planes or aparardha.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">गोप । </span>Not a vocative, but the old accusative of <span class="unicod_norm">गोप्</span> , root <span class="unicod_norm">गूप्</span> modified and forming a noun, both substantive and adjective. Cf Grk. <span class="greek_txt">γύψ</span>, <span class="greek_txt">γύπα</span>. The secondary root <span class="unicod_norm">गूप्</span> is a strongly active, sometimes causal form of <span class="unicod_norm">गू</span>, to seize, swallow up, hold, contain, screen, hide, protect, embrace. The Grk. <span class="greek_txt">γύψ</span>, vulture, is literally the seizer, the bird of prey. It also means, to hide from, fear, shun, loathe (<span class="unicod_norm">जुगुप्सा</span>). In this passage, as in most, it means “protector”.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">अमृतस्य । अ</span>, negative, with <span class="unicod_norm">मृतः</span> mortal, liable to death, Greek <span class="greek_txt">βροτός</span>. The word is not <span class="unicod_norm">अमृतम्</span> but <span class="unicod_norm">अमृतः</span>, used like <span class="unicod_norm">अक्षरः</span>, to connote the Divine Personality, the imperishable being who is not subject to life or death, who as eternal, unchangeable Sat is the source of the principle of Immortality in the world.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">दीदिविम् । </span>Reduplication from <span class="unicod_norm">दिव्</span> to shine, with the nominal termination <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span>. The reduplication gives the idea of intensity, frequency or variety. “A shining force, brilliance, fiery energy.”</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">वर्धमानम् । </span>Rt <span class="unicod_norm">वृध्</span> , secondary root from <span class="unicod_norm">वृ</span> to be, extend, cover, be in force, excel, be in activity, act, operate etc. The sound <span class="unicod_norm">ध्</span> always adds the idea of solid or heavy strength and persistence, — to spread, increase, be exalted.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">स्वे । </span>Own. <span class="unicod_norm">स</span> with the suffix <span class="unicod_norm">व</span> conveying the idea possession, makes either <span class="unicod_norm">स्व</span> (Lat. <span class="unicod_txt">suus</span>) or <span class="unicod_norm">सव</span> (Greek <span class="greek_txt">ἑός</span>) as in <span class="unicod_norm">तव</span>.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">दमे । दम्</span> to conquer entirely, crush, tame, possess as entirely one’s own, with the nominal suffix <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span>. Possession, personal property, home. (Lat. <span class="unicod_txt">domus</span>, Grk. <span class="greek_txt">δόμος</span>.) His own home, ie, the parardha planes as opposed to the Aparardha which he protects.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">स । </span>Again the causal relative sense used loosely to mean therefore.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">नः । </span>The demonstrative <span class="unicod_norm">न</span>, used generally to indicate the person here, I, we.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">पिता । </span>The <span class="unicod_norm">प</span> roots mean principally to reach, obtain, make, do, produce, protect, cherish, strike, strike out. From the sense “to produce” in <span class="unicod_norm">पि</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">पु</span>, come <span class="unicod_norm">पिता</span>, the begetter, and <span class="unicod_norm">पुत्र</span>, the begotten.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">इव । </span>So, as. <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span>, this and <span class="unicod_norm">व</span>. See under <span class="unicod_norm">एव</span> in the third sloka.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">सूनवे । </span>The roots <span class="unicod_norm">सु</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">सू</span> are found chiefly in three senses, to press out, distil, pour out, create, beget, from which we have <span class="unicod_norm">सूनुः</span>, son or daughter, <span class="unicod_norm">सू</span> with the nominal <span class="unicod_norm">नुः</span> (<span class="unicod_norm">न</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">नि</span>); to besiege, strike, attack, wound, (<span class="unicod_norm">सूद्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">सूर्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">सूना</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">सूच्</span> to pierce); and to be at rest, ease, firm, to confirm, ascertain, teach etc, <span class="unicod_norm">सु</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">सुंख</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">सुष्टु</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">सूच्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">सूत्र</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">सूरिः</span> etc. The last is the primary meaning of the roots in <span class="unicod_norm">स</span>, but the addition of <span class="unicod_norm">उ</span>, gives as often an idea of violence, pressure etc, from which comes originally the sense, to press, squeeze, besiege, encroach on, insist, confirm and afterwards all the derivative meanings, even to the most remote from the original idea of rest, eg Greek <span class="greek_txt">σείω</span>, I shake (<span class="unicod_norm">साया</span> from <span class="unicod_norm">सि</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">सी</span>), and the sense of siege and battle common in the Veda. See the next hymn.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">सूपायनो । </span>The adverb <span class="unicod_norm">सु</span>, well or very and <span class="unicod_norm">उपायनो</span>, Rt <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span> with <span class="unicod_norm">आ</span> (making the verb <span class="unicod_norm">ए</span> to go, come, approach) and <span class="unicod_norm">उप</span> towards, with the idea of submission or inferiority, prefixed and followed by the nominal suffix <span class="unicod_norm">न</span> preceded by the enclitic <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span>.

<p class="B-TIT_SUB">Analysis.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">॥१॥ अग्निम् । </span>Agni is a devata, one of the most brilliant and powerful of the masters of the intelligent mind. Man, according to Vedic psychology, consists of seven principles, in which the Atman cases itself, — annam, gross matter; prana, vital energy; manas, intelligent mind; vijnanam, ideal mind; ananda, pure or essential bliss; chit, pure or essential awareness; sat, pure or essential being. In the present stage of our evolution ordinary humanity has developed annam, prana and manas for habitual use; and well-developed men are able to use with power the vijnanam acting not in its own habitation, <span class="unicod_norm">स्वे दमे</span>, nor in its own rupa, vijnanam, but in the mind and as reasoning faculty, buddhi; extraordinary men are able to aid the action of manas and buddhi proper by the vijnanam acting in the intelligent mind indeed and so out of its proper sphere, but in its own form as ideal consciousness — the combination of manasic and vijnani action making what is called genius, pratibhanam, a reflection or luminous response in the mind to higher ideation; the Yogin goes beyond to the vijnanam itself or, if he is one of the greatest Rishis, like Yajnavalkya, to the ananda. None in ordinary times go beyond the ananda in the waking state, for the chit and sat are only attainable in sushupti, because only the first five sheaths or panchakosha are yet sufficiently developed to be visible except to the men of the Satya Yuga and even by them the two others are not perfectly seen. From the vijnanam to the annam is the aparardha or lower part of existence where Vidya is dominated by Avidya; from the ananda to the sat is the parardha or higher half in which Avidya is dominated by Vidya and there is no ignorance, pain or limitation.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">In man as he is at present developed, the intelligent mind is the most important psychological faculty and it is with a view to the development of the intelligent mind to its highest purity and capacity that the hymns of the Veda are written. In this mind there are successively the following principles: sukshma annam, the refinement of the gross annam out of which the physical part of the manahkosha or sukshma deha is made; sukshma prana, the vital energy in the mind which acts in the nadis or nervous system of the sukshma deha and which is the agent of desire; chitta or receptive consciousness, which receives all impressions from without and within by tamasic reaction, but, being tamasic, does not make them evident to the sattwic consciousness or intelligent awareness which we call knowledge, so that we remember with the chitta everything noticed or unnoticed, but that knowledge is useless for our life owing to its lying enveloped in tamas; hrit or the rajasic reaction to impressions which we call feeling or emotion, or, when it is habitual, character; manas or active definite sensational consciousness rendering impressions of all kinds into percept or concept by a sattwic reaction called intelligence or thought which men share with the animals; buddhi or rational, imaginative and intellectually mnemonic faculty, observing, retaining, comparing, reasoning, comprehending, combining and creating, the amalgam of which functions we call intellect; manasa ananda or the pure bliss of existence manifesting through the impure mind, body and prana impurely, ie mixed with pain of various kinds, but in itself pure, because disinterested, ahaituka; manasa tapas or the pure will-power acting towards knowledge, feeling and deed, impurely through the impure mind, body and prana, ie mixed with weakness, dull inertia and ignorance or error; but in itself pure because ahaituka, disinterested, without any ulterior purpose or preference that can interfere with truth of thought, act and emotion; ahaituka sat or pure realisation of existence, operating through the impure organs as ahankara and bheda, egoism and limitation, but in itself pure and aware of unity in difference, because disinterested, not attached to any particular form or name in manifestation; and, finally, Atman or Self seated in mind. This Atman is Sat and Asat, positive and negative, Sad Brahma and Sunyam Brahma; both positive and negative are contained in the Sa or Vasudeva and Tat or Parabrahman, and Sa and Tat are both the same. The Buddhi again is divided into understanding (medha), which merely uses the knowledge given by sensation and like manas, chitta, hrit and prana is adhina, anisha, subject to sensation; reason or buddhi proper, (smriti or dhi, also called prajna), which is superior to sensation and contradicts it in the derived light of a higher knowledge; and direct jnanam, satyam or sattwam which is itself that light of higher knowledge. All these faculties have their own devatas, one or many, each with his ganas or subordinate ministers. The jiva or spirit using these faculties is called the hansa, he who flies or evolves upward; when he leaves the lower and rises to the sacchidananda in the mind, using Sat, chit and ananda only, and reposing in the Sad Atma or in Vasudeva, then he is called the Paramhansa, one who has gone or evolved to the highest in that stage of evolution. This is the fundamental knowledge underlying the Veda, the loss of which, aided by the corruption of nirukta, has led to the present confusion and degradation of its meaning.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">Chandra is the devata of the smriti or prajna; Surya of the satyam; Indra of the understanding and manas; Vayu of the sukshma prana; Mitra, Varuna, Aryama and Bhaga are the four masters of the emotional mind or character; Brihaspati of the sahaituka chit or tapas of knowledge; Brahma of the sahaituka sat; Agni of the sahaituka tapas etc. This is only an indication. The various characteristics and energies of the gods are best developed by an examination of the Veda itself. The gods strive to function perfectly for the Lord or Yajna, the Isha, Master of the adhara or sevenfold medium of manifestation; the Titans or Daityas, equally divine, try to upset this perfect functioning. Their office is to disturb that which is established in order to push man below or give him an opportunity of rising higher by breaking that which was good and harmonious in itself but imperfect, and in any case to render him dissatisfied with anything short of perfection and drive him continually to the Infinite, either by the uttama gati to Vasudeva or, if he will not have that, by the adhama gati to Prakriti. The Vedic Aryans sought to overcome the Daityas or Dasyus by the aid of the gods; afterwards the gods had themselves to be overcome in order that man might reach his goal.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">Agni in the sphere of material energies is the master of tejas, the third and central material principle in the five known to Vedic science. Tejas itself is of seven kinds, chhaya or negative luminosity which is the principle of the annakosha; twilight or dosha, the basis of the pranakosha being tejas modified by chhaya; tejas proper or simple clarity and effulgence, dry light, which is the basis of the manahkosha; jyoti or solar light, brilliance which is the basis of the vijnanakosha; agni or fiery light, which is the basis of the chitkosha; vidyut or electrical illumination, which is the basis of the anandakosha; and prakasha which is the basis of the satkosha. Each of the seven has its own appropriate energy; for the energy is the essential reality and the light only a characteristic accompaniment of the energy. Of all these Agni is the greatest in this world, greater even than Vidyut — although the God of the vaidyuta energy is Vishnu himself who is the Lord of the ananda, the vaidyuto manavah, electrical Man, of the Upanishads. In the vijnana, Surya as well as Vishnu is greater than Agni, but here he and Vishnu both work under the dominant energy of Agni and for the satisfaction of Indra, — Vishnu in the Upanishads being younger than Indra, — Upendra. Translated into the language of physics, this means that Agni, commanding as he does heat and cold, is the fundamental active energy behind all phenomena of light and heat; the Sun is merely a reservoir of light and heat, the peculiar luminous blaze of the sun being only one form of tejas and what we call sunlight is composed of the static energy of prakasha or essential light which is the basis of the satkosha, the electrical energy or vaidyutam, and the tejas of agni modified by the nature of Surya and determining all other forms of light. The prakasha and vaidyutam can only become active when they enter into Agni and work under the conditions of his being and Agni himself is the supplier of Surya; he creates jyoti, he creates tejas, he creates, negatively, chhaya. Right or wrong, this is the physics of the Veda. Translated into the language of psychology, it means that in the intelligent mind, which now predominates, neither jnanam nor ananda can be fully developed, though essentially superior to mind; not even Soma, the rational buddhi, can really govern; but it is Indra full of Soma, the understanding based on the senses and strengthened by the buddhi, who is supreme and for whose satisfaction Soma, Surya, Agni and even the supreme Vishnu work. The reason on which man prides himself, is merely a link in the evolution from the manas to the vijnanam and must serve either the senses or the ideal cognition; if it tries to work for itself it only leads to universal agnosticism, philosophic doubt and the arrest of all knowledge. It must not be thought that the Veda uses these names merely as personifications of psychological and physical forces; it regards these gods as realities standing behind the psychological and physical operations, since no energy can conduct itself, but all need some conscious centre or centres from or through which they proceed. A doubt will naturally arise, how Vishnu, the supreme Lord, can be the Upendra of the Vedas. The answer is that, whatever energy is of supreme importance at a particular stage of the evolution, is taken up by Vishnu-Virat as his especial care. We have seen that the Ananda is now highest in the developed evolution. Vishnu is therefore now preeminently the Lord of the Ananda and when he comes down into the material world he stands in the Sun as the supreme electrical force involved in Agni and evolving out of him, which is the physical counterpart of Ananda and without which no action in the world can proceed. He is not inferior, he only subordinates himself, pretending to serve, while really by service he commands. But Upendratwa is not the highest plane of Vishnu’s manifestation, the param dhama; rather it is a special function here in the lowest dhama. Upendratwa is not Vishnutwa, but only one of its workings.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">Agni, therefore, is master of tejas, especially fiery tejas, and the agent of the sahaituka tapas in the mind. In the language of modern psychology, this sahaituka tapas is Will in action, — not desire, but Will embracing desire and exceeding it. It is not even choice, wish or intention. Will, in the Vedic idea, is essentially knowledge taking the form of force. Agni, therefore, is purely mental force, necessary to all concentration. Once we perceive this Vedic conception, we realise the immense importance of Agni and are in a position to understand the hymn we are studying.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The word Agni is formed from the root <span class="unicod_norm">अग्</span> with the nominal addition <span class="unicod_norm">नि</span>. The root <span class="unicod_norm">अग्</span> is itself a derivative root from the primitive <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span> meaning “to be”, of which traces are found in many languages. The <span class="unicod_norm">ग</span> gives an idea of force and <span class="unicod_norm">अग्</span> therefore means to exist in force, preeminently — to be splendid, strong, excellent and Agni means mighty, supreme, splendid, forceful, bright. We find the same root in the Greek <span class="greek_txt">ἀγαθός</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">agathos</span>, good, meaning originally, strong, noble, brave; <span class="greek_txt">ἄγαν</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">agan</span>, excessively; <span class="greek_txt">ἄγω</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">ago</span>, I lead; Latin, <span class="unicod_txt">ago</span>; <span class="greek_txt">ἀγλαός</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">aglaos</span>, bright; the names <span class="greek_txt">Ἄγις</span>, <span class="greek_txt">Ἀγαμέμνων</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">Agis</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">Agamemnon</span>, and in the Sanscrit <span class="unicod_norm">अग्र</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">अगास्ति</span>. It is interchangeable with its brother root <span class="unicod_norm">अज्</span> from which some of the meanings of <span class="greek_txt">ἄγω</span> are derived. It seems also to have meant to love, from the idea of embracing, cf Greek <span class="greek_txt">ἀγάπη</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">agape</span>, but in this sense the old Sanscrit preferred <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्ग्</span> . For the connection between the two roots, cf <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्गति</span>, in the sense of fire, <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्गिरः</span> as a name of Agni, <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्गारः</span>, a live coal.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">ईळे । </span>The root like all simple Sanscrit roots has two forms <span class="unicod_norm">इळ्</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">ईळ्</span> . The original root was <span class="unicod_norm">इल्</span> to love, embrace, flatter, praise, adore; the cerebral <span class="unicod_norm">ळ</span> is a later form, — a dialectical peculiarity belonging to some of the dominant races of the Dwapara Yuga, which established itself for a time but could not hold its own and either resolved itself back into <span class="unicod_norm">ल</span> or was farther transformed into the soft cerebral <span class="unicod_norm">ड</span> with which it was interchangeable. So we have the form <span class="unicod_norm">ईड्</span> in precisely the same sense. There is no idea necessarily involved of adoration to a superior, the dominant ideas being love, praise and desire. The meaning here is not “praise” or “worship”, but “desire”, “yearn for”.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">पुरो हितम् । </span>The words are two and not one. The sense of “priest, purohit”, put on the compound word in the later ceremonial interpretation of the Veda, is entirely absent in this hymn. The word <span class="unicod_norm">पुरः</span> was originally the genitive of <span class="unicod_norm">पुर्</span> used adverbially. <span class="unicod_norm">पुर्</span> meant door, gate, front, wall; afterwards, house or city; cf the Greek <span class="greek_txt">πύλη</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">pule</span>, a gate, <span class="greek_txt">πύλος</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">pulos</span>, a walled city or fort, <span class="greek_txt">πόλις</span>, a city; so in front. <span class="unicod_norm">हितम्</span> is the participial adjective from the root <span class="unicod_norm">हि</span> in the sense of to cast down, throw down, plant, place, which appears in Greek as <span class="greek_txt">χέω</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">cheo</span>, I pour (<span class="unicod_norm">हया</span>). <span class="unicod_norm">पुरो हितम्</span> means therefore set or planted before.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञस्य । </span>The word <span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञ</span> is of supreme importance in the Veda. In the ceremonial interpretation <span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञ</span> is always understood as sacrifice and no other conception admitted. The Veda cannot be understood as the source of all Indian spirituality and divine knowledge, if this materialistic interpretation is accepted. In reality <span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञ</span> is the name of the Supreme Lord Vishnu himself; it also means <span class="unicod_norm">धर्म</span> or <span class="unicod_norm">योग</span>, and by a later preference of meaning it came to signify sacrifice, because sacrifice in the later Dwapara Yuga became the one dharma and yoga which dominated and more and more tended to replace all others. It is necessary to recover the proper meaning of this important word by Nirukta, and, in order to [do] so, to lay down briefly the principle of Nirukta.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The Sanscrit language is the devabhasha or original language spoken by men in Uttara Meru at the beginning of the Manwantara; but in its purity it is not the Sanscrit of the Dwapara or the Kali, it is the language of the Satyayuga based on the true and perfect relation of vak and artha. Every one of its vowels and consonants has a particular and inalienable force which exists by the nature of things and not by development or human choice; these are the fundamental sounds which lie at the basis of the Tantric bijamantras and constitute the efficacy of the mantra itself. Every vowel and every consonant in the original language had certain primary meanings which arose out of this essential shakti or force and were the basis of other derivative meanings. By combination with the vowels, the consonants, and, without any combination, the vowels themselves formed a number of primary roots, out of which secondary roots were developed by the addition of other consonants. All words were formed from these roots, simple words by the addition again of pure or mixed vowel and consonant terminations with or without modification of the root and more complex words by the principle of composition. This language increasingly corrupted in sense and sound becomes the later Sanscrit of the Treta, Dwapara and Kali Yuga, being sometimes partly purified and again corrupted and again partly purified so that it never loses all apparent relation to its original form and structure. Every other language, however remote, is a corruption formed by detrition and perversion of the original language into a Prakrit or the Prakrit of a Prakrit and so on to increasing stages of impurity. The superior purity of the Indian language is the reason of its being called the Sanscrit and not given any local name, its basis being universal and eternal; and it is always a rediscovery of the Sanscrit tongue as the primary language that prepares first for a true understanding of human language and, secondly, for a fresh purification of Sanscrit itself.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">This particular root <span class="unicod_norm">यज्</span> from which <span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञ</span> is formed, is a secondary root on the base of the consonant <span class="unicod_norm">य्</span> , the gunas of which are strength and tenderness applied to action, motion, formation and contact. The primary roots are <span class="unicod_norm">य</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">यि</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">यु</span>, with their lengthened forms <span class="unicod_norm">या</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">यी</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">यू</span>, — the original devabhasha recognising only three pure vowels, the rest being either modified or mixed vowels. The primary root of <span class="unicod_norm">यज्</span> is <span class="unicod_norm">य</span>, which means essentially to go quietly and persistently, to act or apply oneself quietly and with force and persistence, to master (knowledge or any thing or person) by steady application, to come or bring into contact with gently or lovingly and effectively, to form or express clearly etc. The first sense appears, with its colour rubbed out, in the lengthened form <span class="unicod_norm">या</span>, in <span class="unicod_norm">यक्ष्</span> , in one of the meanings of <span class="unicod_norm">यम्</span> etc; the second in <span class="unicod_norm">यत्</span> &amp; <span class="unicod_norm">यस्</span> ; the third in <span class="unicod_norm">यज्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">यम्</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">यन्त्र्</span> ; the fourth in <span class="unicod_norm">यज्</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">याच्</span> which is originally a causal of <span class="unicod_norm">यच्</span> to give, now lost except in certain conjugational forms of <span class="unicod_norm">यम्</span> ; the fifth in one of the meanings of <span class="unicod_norm">यम्</span> (to show), etc. Besides <span class="unicod_norm">यच्</span> there are other lost roots <span class="unicod_norm">यल्</span> to seek after, love, desire (Greek <span class="greek_txt">ἰάλλω</span>), <span class="unicod_norm">यश्</span> with a similar meaning, from which we have <span class="unicod_norm">यशः</span> which was originally an adjective meaning lovely, charming, and a noun meaning sometimes an object of love or pursuit, sometimes beauty, ambition, fame etc, or love itself, favour, partiality. This is a brief example of the method followed by the original tongue as it can now be observed with its distinctions and shades confused and the colours of the words expunged.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">In the root <span class="unicod_norm">यज्</span> the force of the consonant <span class="unicod_norm">ज्</span> determines the meaning. Its essential nature is swiftness, decisiveness, rapid brilliance and restlessness. It has therefore a frequentative and intensitive force. It means to love habitually and fervently, so to worship, to adore. It means to give freely, wholly or continuously; from these shades comes the meaning of sacrifice. It means to master thoroughly, habitually, with a continual repetition of the act of mastery; the word <span class="unicod_norm">यत्</span> means endeavour, but <span class="unicod_norm">यज्</span> can never have meant endeavour, it is too decisive and triumphant and must imply possession of mastery, action sure of its result. It means therefore to rule, govern, order, possess. That is why <span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञ</span> is Vishnu, in the sense of the Almighty Ruler, the Master of man’s action, body, thought, the supreme Lord ruling from the higher faculty in man, the parardha or Sacchidananda.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञः</span> is formed by the addition of <span class="unicod_norm">न</span>, a nominal suffix which has the sense of action. It may be adjectival or nominal. It may convey the actor, the instrument, the manner or the sufferer of the action. <span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञः</span> therefore came to mean, he who rules, the governor or master; loving, adoring, also he who is loved; the means of mastery and so Yoga, in its processes, not in its realisations; the manner of mastery and so dharma, a rule of action or self-government; adoration or an act of worship, though this sense was usually kept for <span class="unicod_norm">यजुः</span>, giving, offering, sacrifice. As the name of Vishnu it meant, predominantly, the Master who directs, compels and governs; but the idea of the Lover and Beloved, the Giver and the object of all action, ritual and worship, of all karma also entered into it in the associations of the worshipper and sometimes became prominent.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The Vishnu Purana tells us that Vishnu in the Satya Yuga incarnates as Yajna, in the Treta as the conqueror and king, in the Dwapara as Vyasa, the compiler, codifier and lawgiver. It is not meant that He incarnates as sacrifice. The Satya Yuga is the age of human perfection when a harmonious order is established, the perfect or chatuspad dharma, whose maintenance depends on the full and universal possession of Yoga or direct relation to God and that again on the continual presence of incarnate Vishnu as the Adored, the Master and centre of dharma and yoga. The chatuspad dharma is the perfect harmony of the four dharmas, Brahmanyam, Kshatram, Vaishyam and Shaudram; for this reason separate castes do not exist in the Satya Yuga. In the Treta the Brahmanyam begins to fail, but remains as a subordinate force to help the Kshatram which then governs humanity. Mankind is maintained no longer by viryam or tapas easily sustained by inherent Brahmajnanam, but by viryam or tapas sustaining the Brahmajnanam with some difficulty and preventing its collapse. Vishnu incarnates as the Kshatriya, the incarnate centre of viryam and tapas. In the Dwapara, the Brahmanyam farther fails and turns into mere knowledge or intellectuality, the Kshatram becomes a subordinate force supporting the Vaishyam which has its turn of supremacy. The main qualities of the Vaishya are kaushalam, order and method, and therefore the Dwapara is the age of codification, ritual, Shastra, external appliances to maintain the failing internal spirituality; danam, and therefore hospitality, liberality, the sacrifice and the dakshina begin to swallow up other dharmas — it is the yuga yajniya, — the age of sacrifice; bhoga, and therefore the Veda is used for procuring enjoyment in this world and the next, bhogaishwaryagatim prati. Vishnu incarnates as the lawgiver, ritualist and Shastrakara to preserve the knowledge and practice of the dharma by the aid of the intellect and abhyasa, customary practice based on intellectual knowledge. In the Kali all breaks down except love and service, the dharma of the Shudra by which humanity is maintained and from time to time purified; for the jnanam breaks down and is replaced by worldly, practical reason, the viryam breaks down and is replaced by lazy mechanical appliances for getting things done lifelessly with the least trouble, dana, yajna and shastra break down and are replaced by calculated liberality, empty ritual and tamasic social forms and etiquette. Love is brought in by the Avataras to break down these dead forms in order that the world may be rejuvenated and a new order and a new Satya Yuga emerge, when the Lord will again incarnate as Yajna, the supreme Vishnu in the full manifestation of the chatuspad dharma, knowledge, power, enjoyment and love.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">It has been said that Vishnu in our present stage of evolution is preeminently the Lord of the Ananda, but he is also the Sanmay Brahman and the Tapomay. It is as the Sanmay that He is Yajna — the Sat containing in it the Chit or Tapas and the Ananda. It must be remembered that while in the Aparardha we envisage Brahman through thought, feeling, action etc, in the Parardha we envisage Him through essential realisation superior to thought, feeling and action. In the Ananda we realise essential delight; in the Chit, essential energy, intelligence and will; in the Sat, essential truth or be-ness. The Sat is therefore called the Mahasatyam and Mahakaranam, the highest truth in the manifestation, out of which everything proceeds. It is by this Mahasatyam — distinguished from the ordinary satyam or karanam called objectively mahat and subjectively vijnanam, the fourth of the seven bhumis, — that Vishnu as Yajna supports the dharma and yoga in the Satya Yuga. He is the Sad Brahma in manifestation. We shall see when we deal with the word <span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्विजम्</span> in what sense Agni stands before the Lord.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">देवम् । </span>A god. From the secondary root <span class="unicod_norm">दिव्</span> to flash, gleam, vibrate, play. On the basis of the consonant <span class="unicod_norm">द्</span> of which the gunas are force, heavy violence, density, dense penetration, dense movement, we get <span class="unicod_norm">दा</span> to cut, <span class="unicod_norm">दि</span> to vibrate and <span class="unicod_norm">दु</span> to trouble and from <span class="unicod_norm">दि</span> we get <span class="unicod_norm">द्यु</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">दिव्</span> or <span class="unicod_norm">दीव्</span> meaning to vibrate shiningly, gleam, scintillate or play. The Devas are those who play in light. Their proper home is in the vijnanam, <span class="unicod_norm">महर्लोक</span> or karanajagat, where matter is jyotirmay and all things luminous <span class="unicod_norm">स्वेन धाम्ना</span>, by their own inherent lustre and where life is an ordered lila or play. Therefore when the Bhagawat speaks of the power of seeing the life of the gods in Swarga, it calls that particular siddhi <span class="unicod_norm">देवक्रीडानुदर्शनम्</span> , watching the sports of the gods, because all life is to them a sport or lila. The Gods, however, dwell for us in the lower Swarloka, ie, Chandraloka of which the summit is Kailas and the basis Swarga with Pitriloka just above Swarga. Nevertheless even there they keep their jyotirmay and lilamay nature, their luminous bodies and worlds of self-existent bliss free from death and care.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्विजम् । </span>This word is taken in the ceremonial interpretation of the Veda in the later sense of Ritwik, a sacrificial priest, and it is explained by separating as <span class="unicod_norm">ऋतु</span> + <span class="unicod_norm">इज्</span> one who sacrifices seasonably. In reality, <span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्विज्</span> is a very old word compounded in ancient Sanscrit before the creation of the modern rules of Sandhi, and is composed of <span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्</span> truth and <span class="unicod_norm">विज्</span> , ecstasy or ecstatic. It means one who has the ecstasy of the truth or satyam.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्</span> is an abstract noun formed from the root <span class="unicod_norm">ऋ</span> whose essential meaning was to vibrate, shake, dart, go straight; and its derivate meanings to reach, acquire, or else attack, hurt, injure, or to be erect, rise or raise; to shine; to think, realise truth etc. From the sense of going straight in the secondary verb <span class="unicod_norm">ऋज्</span> with its adjective <span class="unicod_norm">ऋजु</span> straight, cf Lat. <span class="unicod_txt">rego</span>, <span class="unicod_txt">rectus</span>; <span class="unicod_norm">ऋत</span> straight, right, true; <span class="unicod_norm">ऋतम्</span> , truth, right, established law or custom, — <span class="unicod_norm">सत्यम्</span> applied to the Supreme Brahman as the satyam or mahakaranam; <span class="unicod_norm">ऋतु</span>, rule, fixed order, fixed time or season; <span class="unicod_norm">ऋषि</span>, a thinker, direct seer of truth, cf Lat. <span class="unicod_txt">reor</span>, I think, <span class="unicod_txt">ratio</span>, method, order, reason, proposition, etc. The obsolete word <span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्</span> meant directness, truth, law, rule, thought, <span class="unicod_norm">सत्यम्</span> .</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">विज्</span> is noun or adjective from the verb <span class="unicod_norm">विज्</span> meaning to shake, be troubled, excited, tremble, to be ecstatic, joyous, full of rapture, felicity or ecstatic energy. Cf Latin <span class="unicod_txt">vigeo</span> and <span class="unicod_txt">vigor</span>, from which comes the English vigour. <span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्विज्</span> is therefore one who is ecstatic with the fullness of the truth or satyam. Agni, it has been pointed out, is the god of the tapas or energy at work disinterestedly on the intellectual plane, one of the higher gods working on the lower level in the service of the lower deity Indra. He proceeds straight from the chit, which, when active, is known as mahatapas or chichchhakti, the energy of the essential intelligence in the Sad Brahman, Yajna or Vishnu. The Shakti begins creation by kshobha or ecstatic vibration in the calm Sad Atma and this ecstatic vibration or <span class="unicod_norm">विज्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">वेगः</span> goes out as speed, force, heat, <span class="unicod_norm">तपः</span> or <span class="unicod_norm">अग्नि</span>, the basis of life and existence. This tapas born of the Chichchhakti (Shakti, Devi, Kali, Prakriti) is full of the ecstatic movement of the Sat or Mahasatyam manifesting itself. For this reason Agni is called <span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्विज्</span> , vibrating, ecstatic with the <span class="unicod_norm">सत्यम्</span> . For the same reason he is called <span class="unicod_norm">जातवेदाः</span>, he from whom the higher knowledge is born, because he holds in himself the Veda or Satyam and manifests it; tapas is the basis of all concentration of chit, awareness (the sanyama of Patanjali) and it is by sanyama or concentration of awareness either on the object of awareness (rajayoga) or on itself (jnanayoga and adhyatmayoga) that satyam and Veda become directly self-manifest and luminous to the Yogin. Without this sanyama no Yoga is possible, no effective action of any kind is possible. When Brahma turned his mind to creation, it was the cry of “tapas, tapas” that was heard on the waters of the karan samudra (Mahakaranam or Sad Brahma). The immense importance of Agni as the Ritwij to the Yogin, therefore, becomes manifest; and it is also clear why he is <span class="unicod_norm">पुरोहितं यज्ञस्य</span> for it is the tapas which stands before the Satyam, which we reach before we can get the Sat. It is the Chichchhakti which takes us to the Sat, — the Devi, Shakti or Kali who brings us to Brahman, to Vasudeva, and Agni, her especial agent for tapas in the mind, is therefore a special intermediary between us and Yajna, who, as has been seen, is Vishnu, Vasudeva or Brahman, in the Sacchidananda or Parardha on the intellectual plane, which is all man in the average has yet reached. This is the reason why Agni was so great a god to the Rishis. To mere sacrificers and ritualists he was great only as the god of fire indispensable in all their ritual, but to the Yogin he has a much greater importance, as great as that of Surya, the lord of illumination, and Soma, the lord of Amrita. He was one of the most indispensable helpers in the processes which the Veda illumines and assists.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">होतारम् । </span>Hota is another word of great importance in the Veda. In all existing interpretations of the Veda hota is interpreted as the priest who offers the libation, <span class="unicod_norm">हविः</span> as the libation and <span class="unicod_txt">hu</span> in the sense of pouring the offering. So fixed is this notion born of the predomination through several millenniums of the ceremonial meanings attached to all the important words of the Veda, that any other rendering would be deemed impossible. But in the original Veda <span class="unicod_norm">होता</span> did not mean a sacrificial priest, nor <span class="unicod_norm">हविः</span> an offering. Agni may by a metaphorical figure be called a purohit of the sacrifice, though the figure will not have any very great Sanscritic exactness, but he can in no sense be the one who pours the libation. He devours the libation, he does not offer or pour it. Hota, therefore, must have some other signification which, without outraging fact and common sense, can be applied to Agni.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The root <span class="unicod_norm">हु</span>, like the roots <span class="unicod_norm">हा</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">हि</span>, is based on the consonant <span class="unicod_norm">ह्</span> , the essential gunas of which are aggression, violent action, impetuosity, loud breathing, and so challenge, summons etc. The verb <span class="unicod_norm">हु</span> originally like <span class="unicod_norm">ह</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">हा</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">हि</span> meant to strike or throw down, attack, slay, the vowel <span class="unicod_norm">उ</span> adding a sense of pervasiveness which easily brought the idea of battle. We find, therefore, that this root meant to attack, fight, as in <span class="unicod_norm">आहवः</span> battle; to call, shout, summons, as in <span class="unicod_norm">ह्वे</span> (originally <span class="unicod_norm">हवे</span>) etc; to throw, overthrow, destroy; to throw, pour, offer. From the last sense it came to have its more modern meaning. The transference from the sense of battle to the sense of sacrifice is paralleled by the Greek word <span class="greek_txt">μάχη</span>, battle, which is certainly the same as the Sanscrit <span class="unicod_norm">मखः</span>, sacrifice. It must be remembered that the Yoga was to the old Aryans a battle between the Devas and Daityas, the gods being the warriors who fought the Daityas for man and were made strong and victorious by the <span class="unicod_norm">क्रिया</span>-s or effective practices of Yoga, the Daityas being the Dasyus or enemies of Yajna and Yoga. This will become clearer and clearer as we proceed. This view of life as well as Yoga, which is only the sublimation of life, as a struggle between the Devas &amp; Daityas is one of the most fundamental ideas of Veda, Purana, Tantra and every practical system in Hinduism. Agni is par excellence the warrior whom the Daityas most dread, because he is full of the ahaituka tapas, against which, if properly used and supported by the Yajamana, the Yogin, no evil force can prevail. The Ahaituka Tapas destroys them all. It is the mighty effective and fighting force which once called in prepares perfect siddhi and an almost omnipotent control over our nature and our surroundings. Even when ashuddha, impure, tapas fights the enemy tamas; when shuddha, when the very action of Agni, it brings viryam, it brings jnanam, it brings Ananda, it brings mukti. Hotaram means therefore the warrior, the destroyer of the Daityas, Agni jatavedas; havis and hava mean battle or strength in violent action; hu to fight.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">रत्नधातमम् । </span>Superlative of <span class="unicod_norm">रत्नधा</span>, joy-giving, the disposer of delight. We have the root <span class="unicod_norm">रत्</span> as a derivative from the primary root <span class="unicod_norm">र</span>. The three roots <span class="unicod_norm">र</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">रि</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">रु</span> are themselves variations of the elemental shabda <span class="unicod_norm">र्</span> whose essential significance is tremulous continual vibration. <span class="unicod_norm">र</span> means essentially to vibrate, shake, quiver abroad, the vowel <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span> conveying essentiality, absoluteness, wideness, want of limitation as opposed to the vowel <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span> which gives a sense of relation and direction to a given point. From this essential sense come the derivative meanings, to play, to shine; as in <span class="unicod_norm">रतम्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">रत्न</span> a jewel, <span class="unicod_norm">रतिः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">रम्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">रञ्ज्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">रजतम्</span> silver, <span class="unicod_norm">रजः</span> dust, <span class="unicod_norm">रजनी</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">रात्रि</span>, night etc. From the former meaning there comes the sense, to please, delight, love, adore, etc. as in <span class="unicod_norm">रामा</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">रामः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">राध्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">रज्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">रजः</span>, (rajoguna) etc. The word <span class="unicod_norm">रत्न</span> in ancient Sanscrit, from the root <span class="unicod_norm">रत्</span> , had two sets of senses, delight, ananda, pleasure, play, sexual intercourse, a thing of delight, mistress, etc, and splendour, light, lustre, brilliance, a brilliant, a jewel, — the modern sense. At first sight it would seem that lustre, brilliance is more appropriate to Agni, and it would apply well to the warrior who destroys the darkness of the mind, but the central idea of the hymn is not Agni as the master of light, — that is Surya, — but as the master of force, tapas, which is the source out of which comes delight. The three terms of the parardha are sat, chit and ananda. In sat, chit abides and emerges from sat. As soon as it emerges, it generates the energy of chichchhakti which plays throughout the universe; this play, <span class="unicod_norm">रत्न</span>, is ananda in chit and it emerges from chit. All tapas therefore generates ananda, and the pure sahaituka tapas generates pure sahaituka ananda which being universal, self-existent and by its nature incapable of any admixture of sorrow, is the most sure, wide, and intense. Therefore Agni is most joy-giving, a great disposer of delight. The word <span class="unicod_norm">धा</span> means to set, create, give, arrange; here it is the old Aryan substantive expressing the agent and often used adjectivally.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">॥२॥ अग्निः पूर्वेभिर्ऋषिभिरीड्यो नूतनैरुत </span>There is nothing in these words that needs special explanation, since all the words and their senses are modern. The Rishi indicates Agni, master of the ahaituka tapas, as adorable in all ages by all seers ancient or modern, because to all seekers and at all times, ahaituka tapas is the condition and agent of suddhi, mukti, bhukti and siddhi, the fourfold aim of Yoga. The word Rishi means a knower of truth, one who attains, from <span class="unicod_norm">ऋ</span> to go straight, attain the goal, reach the object, know, think. Originally it had something of the sense of <span class="unicod_norm">साधक</span>, the <span class="unicod_norm">ष</span> giving a habitual force; one who continually goes straight (by knowledge or inspired thought) to the truth. The force of <span class="unicod_norm">उत</span> is here, “much more”, “as a matter of course”. The idea is that not only is Agni the great object of desire and worship to the high sadhaks of these days, but in all times he has occupied the same place in the sadhan, even when man was in a different stage of evolution and walked in other paths of Yoga. Whatever Yoga is adopted, sahaituka tapas is of the first importance to full siddhi.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">स । </span>Sa is here used much in the sense of “who”, — it is the Greek <span class="greek_txt">ἃς</span> (originally <span class="greek_txt">σός</span> though by a common law in Greek the <span class="greek_txt">σ</span> has been worn into an aspirate), and it gives the reason for the adoration of Agni.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">देवान् । </span>The gods of the lower functions in the body, prana, mind and vijnana are all borne up by the impartial strength of Agni and the delight, <span class="unicod_norm">रत्न</span>, which it generates. Ananda is the condition of all existence and persistence, — <span class="unicod_norm">को ह्येवान्यात् कः प्राण्यात् यदेष आकाश आनन्दो न स्यात् ॥</span>. Tapas is the stay, the supporter of ananda. Therefore Agni bears up the gods.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">एह । </span>From root <span class="unicod_norm">इह्</span> , an adverb meaning forcefully, with strength. The root <span class="unicod_norm">इह्</span> meant originally to put forth strength in a given direction, so to will, wish, desire. Cf for this sense of derivatives from the primary root <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span>, Greek <span class="greek_txt">ῖφι</span>, <span class="greek_txt">ἴφθιμος</span>, <span class="greek_txt">ἴς</span> (<span class="greek_txt">ῖνα</span>), <span class="unicod_norm">इन्द्र</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">ईर्</span> to utter, force out, etc. The adverb used is especially appropriate to the action of the god of tapas; it is in strength, by the force of tapas that he supports all the gods.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">वक्षति । </span>The root is <span class="unicod_norm">वह्</span> + <span class="unicod_norm">ष</span>, and <span class="unicod_norm">ष</span> in old Sanscrit gave a habituative or desiderative sense, the two being kin to each other, cf the Greek <span class="greek_txt">φιλεῖ</span>, meaning both “loves” and “is wont to”. Cf also the previous note about <span class="unicod_norm">ऋषि</span>. We shall meet this habituative form frequently. Agni is wont to bear up, that is his perpetual office.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">॥३॥ अग्निना रयिम् </span>The word <span class="unicod_norm">रयिः</span> (Latin <span class="unicod_txt">res</span>) means substance. It comes from the root <span class="unicod_norm">र</span> to vibrate + <span class="unicod_norm">इः</span>, an ordinary nominal termination which, when feminine, usually gives the idea of quality or abstract existence. In ancient Sanscrit the semivowels <span class="unicod_norm">य</span> &amp; <span class="unicod_norm">व</span> were used to bridge over the gap between two vowels, as in <span class="unicod_norm">म्रिये</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">जाये</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">हुवे</span>, and this usage has been faithfully preserved in one of its surviving daughters of an elder group, Tamil. <span class="unicod_norm">रयिः</span> therefore means vibration, stir, play, motion, and, because all substance is merely Prakriti or Shakti in motion, it comes to mean substance. The word and the meaning are among the oldest in Sanscrit. By Agni, by sahaituka tapas is got or enjoyed substance, body. Into whatever that stream of force flows, however unsubstantial it may be at the time, it grows in body, being and solidity; it tends to establish itself, to become a <i>res</i> or established actual thing.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">अश्नवत् । </span>The word <span class="unicod_norm">अश्</span> is a secondary root from <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span> to be, one of the most important of all old Sanscrit roots. From this root we have <span class="unicod_norm">अस्</span> to be, breathe, live, be strong; <span class="unicod_norm">अद्</span> to be (annam, substance, matter), to eat (<span class="unicod_norm">अन्नं</span> food); <span class="unicod_norm">अह्</span> to breathe (<span class="unicod_norm">अही</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">प्राह</span>); <span class="unicod_norm">अन्</span> to breathe, live, be (<span class="unicod_norm">अनिलः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">प्राणः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">अनु</span>); <span class="unicod_norm">अर्</span> to be, be strong, excel, fight, rule (<span class="unicod_norm">अरिः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">आर्य</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">अर्यमा</span>, Gr. <span class="greek_txt">ἀρετή</span>, <span class="greek_txt">Ἄρης</span>) and a number of others. Every Aryan primary root was capable of being used either transitively or intransitively, and in its transitive sense <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span> meant “to have”, whence we get <span class="unicod_norm">अश्</span> to have, possess, enjoy, eat, get, acquire. <span class="unicod_norm">अश्</span> becomes in Greek <span class="greek_txt">ἔχω</span>. Here both the senses of “get”, and “enjoy”, must be taken together. The root is one of those which still preserves the old verbal enclitics <span class="unicod_norm">न</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">ना</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">नु</span>. The verbal termination <span class="unicod_norm">वत्</span> is here used impersonally; one gets, there is got.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">पोषमेव । </span>The sense of <span class="unicod_norm">पोषम्</span> is “increase”. The word completes the sense of <span class="unicod_norm">रयिमश्नवत्</span> which, without the addition of <span class="unicod_norm">पोषम्</span> , might only imply a single and immediate accretion of substance, but the Rishi refers to the steady action of sahaituka tapas in the Yoga, by which once the stream of Agni is set flowing on the guna, vritti or jnanam to be obtained, it inevitably proceeds to get actuality and to increase in substance and power from day to day until it acquires <span class="unicod_norm">यशसं वीरवत्तमम्</span> , the utmost manifestation of splendour.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">The root <span class="unicod_norm">पु</span> is important in Vedic etymology. The letter <span class="unicod_norm">प्</span> has the signification of sharp, swift and decisive movement, contact, formation etc. The roots based upon it give us variations of the ideas, “to rush, fall, dart, strike, leap, soar; to seize, master, own, be lord of; to enjoy, take, take in, devour, drain, drink, fill oneself, fill; to strike out, forge, do, make, effect; to produce, bring to being or fulfilment; increase, advance” and others developing from the elementary idea of the vocable. We get from the root <span class="unicod_norm">पु</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">पुत्र</span> one produced, cf Latin <span class="unicod_txt">pullus</span>, a son; <span class="unicod_norm">पू</span> to perfect, <span class="unicod_norm">पूतः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">पूताः</span> (Vedic), <span class="unicod_norm">पुण्यं</span> perfection, virtue, merit; <span class="unicod_norm">पवनः</span> the wind, (the rushing one); <span class="unicod_norm">पूषा</span> the Sun, he who fosters, develops and perfects; <span class="unicod_norm">पोषः</span> increase; <span class="unicod_norm">पूज्</span> to foster, cherish, adore, worship; <span class="unicod_norm">पुर्</span> increase, advance, forwardness, front (<span class="unicod_norm">पुरः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">पूर्वः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">पुरा</span>, before, O.S. <span class="unicod_norm">पुरा</span> (Gr. <span class="greek_txt">πύλη</span>) door, gate, <span class="unicod_norm">पुर्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">पुरः</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">पुती</span> front, wall, fortified town, Gr. <span class="greek_txt">Πύλος</span>, <span class="greek_txt">πόλις</span>) etc.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">एव</span> in later Sanscrit means “indeed”, giving emphasis, or has a limiting and restricting sense, eg Isha Upanishad <span class="unicod_norm">कुर्वन्नेव कर्माणि</span>, “Thou shalt verily do actions (and not refrain from them).” But in old Sanscrit its original force was that of <span class="unicod_norm">एवम्</span> , so, this, thus; and then “and, also”. In the latter sense <span class="unicod_norm">एवम्</span> is still used in literary Bengali, for the spoken Sanscrit of the provinces often preserved forms and meanings the literary language lost and these, more or less corrupted, have passed into our modern vernaculars.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">दिवे दिवे । </span>From day to day. By the mere lapse of time, without effort on our part, the mere action of Agni being sufficient. This is an important principle of Yogic psychology which will be explained in the Commentary. The word <span class="unicod_norm">दिवः</span> is from <span class="unicod_norm">दिव्</span> to shine and may mean either “day”, <span class="unicod_norm">दिवः कालः</span> the bright period, or “heaven”, <span class="unicod_norm">दिवो लोकः</span>, the bright world. It has both senses in the Veda.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">यशसम् । </span>The word <span class="unicod_txt">yaśas</span> is from the root <span class="unicod_norm">यशस्</span> , a secondary root from the primary <span class="unicod_norm">य</span>.</p>

<p class="P5_30_150_0_j">A hymn of praise, welcome and prayer to Agni, Lord of Tejas, composed when the mind of the Yogin Madhuchchhanda was full of sattwic energy and illumination.</p>
<p class="P5_0_150_20_j">1. Agni the brilliant I adore who standeth before the Lord, the god that has the ecstasy of the truth, the fighter that fulfilleth utter bliss.</p>
<p class="P5_0_150_20_j">2. Agni adorable to the sages of old, adorable to the new, holds up the gods with force &amp; might.</p>

<p class="P5_0_150_20_j">6. O beloved, that to the foe who would destroy thee thou, O Agni, doest good, this is the Truth of thee, O Lord of Love.</p>

<p class="B-TIT_SUB">Linguistic</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">अग्निम्</span> . The word Agnis is composed of the root <span class="unicod_norm">अग्</span> , the suffix <span class="unicod_norm">नि</span> and the case-ending <span class="unicod_norm">स्</span> . The root <span class="unicod_norm">अग्</span> occurs in two other words of this hymn, <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्ग</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">अङ्गिरः</span>. Its most common meaning is love, force or excellence. The original root <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span> of which it is a primary derivative meant existence. The addition of <span class="unicod_norm">ग्</span> adds the sense of force or power. To exist in force or power is <span class="unicod_norm">अग्</span> in its initial sense and all other meanings are derivative or deductive from the initial sense. The sound <span class="unicod_norm">न्</span> is added to roots with an adjectival force as in <span class="unicod_norm">रत्न</span> from <span class="unicod_norm">रत्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञ</span> from <span class="unicod_norm">यज्</span> . It may have adherent to it either <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span> or <span class="unicod_norm">उ</span>, and may be pure or preceded by the enclitics <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">उ</span> or their prolonged forms <span class="unicod_norm">आ</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">ई</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">ऊ</span>. Thus <span class="unicod_norm">करण</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">शयान</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">बकिन्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">राजन्</span> , <span class="unicod_norm">वरुण</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">इष्णु</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">विष्णु</span> etc. <span class="unicod_norm">अग्नि</span> means one who exists in force or power. Cf the Greek <span class="greek_txt">ἄγαν</span>, exceedingly, <span class="greek_txt">ἀγαθός</span>, good, originally meaning strong, powerful, brave. From the same sense of power, force, excellence come various senses of <span class="greek_txt">ἄγω</span>, the Latin <span class="unicod_txt">ago</span>, lead, drive, act, etc. On the other hand the insertion of the nasal sound between <span class="unicod_norm">अ</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">ग्</span> gives the sense of love, sweetness, softness, beauty, as the particular kind of force or excellence implied in the root.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">ईळे</span>. The root <span class="unicod_norm">ईल्</span> , dialectically <span class="unicod_norm">ईळ्</span> , also takes by a slight modification of sound the form <span class="unicod_norm">ईड्</span> . It is a primary derivative of the original root <span class="unicod_norm">इ</span>, implying motion towards. The addition of <span class="unicod_norm">ल्</span> gives the sense of approaching with love and gives rise to the signification, <i>adore</i>, <i>worship</i>. It has a strong sense of <span class="unicod_txt">bhakti</span>, emotional worship.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">पुरो हितम्</span> . Two separate words, adverb and participle, “set before”. The participle is generally treated as belonging to <span class="unicod_norm">धा</span>, but it is originally the past verbal adjective of <span class="unicod_norm">हि</span>. The sound <span class="unicod_norm">ह्</span> conveys contact, motion or emission with force. Thus the root <span class="unicod_norm">ह</span> is to throw, strike, kill and in its derivatives to leap, dance etc. The root <span class="unicod_norm">हु</span> is similarly to attack, fight, throw from one, drag away etc. The root <span class="unicod_norm">हि</span> means to pierce, penetrate, adhere, be set in and actively to strike away, wear away, impair with other meanings. From the sense of adherence, we get a deductive sense of fondness, clinging, love, friendliness, the classic significance of the adjective <span class="unicod_norm">हित</span>.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञस्य</span>. This word is of the utmost importance in the Veda. Its subsequent meaning of sacrifice has overclouded the sense of the Scriptures ever since the later half of the Dwapara Yuga; but originally and in the age of Madhuchchhanda it had no shade of this meaning. It is the root <span class="unicod_norm">यज्</span> with the suffix <span class="unicod_norm">न</span> adjectival, as explained under <span class="unicod_norm">अग्नि</span>. <span class="unicod_norm">यज्</span> is a primary derivative from the initial root <span class="unicod_norm">य</span> which had a sense of control, restraint, persistence, preservation. This we find in its derivatives <span class="unicod_norm">यम्</span> to order, control, regulate; <span class="unicod_norm">यत्</span> to use force upon, strive, practise; <span class="unicod_norm">यक्ष्</span> the habituative, to keep carefully from which <span class="unicod_norm">यक्ष</span> the guardians of wealth, the <span class="unicod_txt">ganas</span>, hosts of Kuvera; <span class="unicod_norm">यछ्</span> to importune, entreat, supplicate; <span class="unicod_norm">यच्</span> to control, to regulate, distribute, give. <span class="unicod_norm">यज्</span> means to regulate, rule, order, govern. <span class="unicod_norm">यज्ञ</span> is He who does these things, the Lord, Governor, Master, Provider, Giver, and in the Veda it is applied to the Supreme Being, Parameshwara, who governs the universe as the Master of Nature, the Disposer of its Laws, the Almighty Providence, the Master of the Dharma. It has a similar sense to the word <span class="unicod_norm">यमः</span> applied to the single god of Dharma, Yama. There is an echo of this use in the Vishnu Purana when it is said that Vishnu is born in the Satya Yuga as Yajna, in the Treta as the Chakravarti Raja, in the Dwapara as Vyasa. In the Satya Yuga mankind is governed by its own pure, perfect and inborn nature spontaneously fulfilling the <span class="unicod_txt">dharma</span> under the direct inspiration of God within as Yajna, the Lord of the Dharma. In the Treta the Dharma is maintained by the sceptre and the sword guarding the unwritten law. In the Dwapara the Dharma is supported by codes, Shastras, a regulated and written system.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">देवम्</span> . From the root <span class="unicod_norm">दिव्</span> conveying the idea of active, rapid or brilliant energy. It means to shine, to play, (cf <span class="unicod_norm">दीव्</span> to gamble), to be bright, clear, strong, swift or luminous. The Devas are strictly speaking the sattwic and rajasic powers of the sukshma worlds, Swar and Bhuvar, who govern or assist the operations of intelligence and energy in man; but it came to be applied to all beings of the other worlds without distinction, even to the tamasic forces, beings and powers who hurt and oppose these very operations. It is in this latter sense that the Persians used it after the teachings of Jarad-drashta (Zaruthrusta, Jaratkaru) had accustomed them to apply other terms to the beneficent and helpful powers.</p>
<p class="P5_30_150_0_j"><span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्विजम्</span> . The word <span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्विक्</span> like the word <span class="unicod_norm">पुरोहितम्</span> only latterly came to mean a sacrificial priest. It is composed of two words <span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">विज्</span> . In Old Sanscrit <span class="unicod_norm">ऋ</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">रि</span> were used inter-changeably like <span class="unicod_norm">ळ</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">ड</span>. The root <span class="unicod_norm">ऋ</span> conveyed the idea of fixity, constancy, <span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्</span> or <span class="unicod_norm">रित्</span> is the old verbal noun forming the roots <span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्</span> and <span class="unicod_norm">रित्</span> and conveys the ideas [of] fixity, persistence, constancy, truth, steadfastness, wisdom, <span class="unicod_norm">धैर्य</span>, <span class="unicod_norm">सत्यं</span>. From the same root is formed <span class="unicod_norm">ऋषिः</span>, the root <span class="unicod_norm">ऋष्</span> being a habituative form of <span class="unicod_norm">ऋ</span> and meaning to be constant, wise, true, steadfast, calm and still. It was the old word answering to the <span class="unicod_norm">धीर</span> of the Upanishads. Similarly <span class="unicod_norm">ऋतम्</span> means truth, law etc, <span class="unicod_norm">ऋतु</span> is the fixed period or season, the habitual menstruation etc. The word <span class="unicod_norm">विज्</span> is a derivative of the initial root <span class="unicod_norm">वि</span> to open, manifest, from which are formed <span class="unicod_norm">विद्</span> to see, the root <span class="unicod_norm">विल्</span> conveying the idea of publicity, light, etc common in Tamil and Latin, and <span class="unicod_norm">विज्</span> meaning also to see. The <span class="unicod_norm">ऋत्विज्</span> is the drashta, seer or rishi, the one who has vision of spiritual truth.</p>
